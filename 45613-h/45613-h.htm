  <h1 class='c006'>DON WINSLOW OF THE NAVY</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c007'>I<br /> <br /><i>BOMBED!</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the white sand of a jungle bordered cove, two
men and a girl stood gazing seaward, their eyes
shielded against the rising sun’s first beams. To judge
by their torn, mudstained clothing, they had been meeting
hardship in large, tough chunks. Out here on the
beach they would soon face more of it, when the sun
grew hot enough to broil a white man’s skin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The slim, dark-eyed girl had suffered less, apparently,
than her two companions. Yet her stout whipcord
breeches showed rough wear, and her face, under a
mass of wind blown curls, bore traces of weariness and
jungle dirt. The society columnist who had described
her coiffure at a Washington ball, six weeks ago,
would have been startled to recognize Mercedes Colby,
daughter of a retired Navy Admiral.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even more sharply would that columnist have been
astonished by the identity of Miss Colby’s present escorts.
For United States Naval Commanders are not
ordinarily found in beachcombers’ rags, on the shore of
a tropical island. And nothing in the book of Navy
Regulations (which covers everything) decrees that
even a lieutenant must tackle the Haitian jungle barefooted,
with half a shirt tucked into the remnant of
once-white trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth was that ordinary duties had never been
the lot of Don Winslow and his husky shadow Lieutenant
“Red” Pennington since their appointment to
the Naval Intelligence Service. In a few adventure-packed
months they had learned to take hardships as a
daily ration, with danger for spice. Hunger, exhaustion,
blistered skin and bleeding feet, were small matters
compared with the importance of their present job—the
stamping out of a vast international crime ring,
whose deliberate aim was to plunge the whole world
into war.</p>

<p class='c009'>To combat this secret menace the United States
Government had needed an officer of rare courage and
ability for its chief field operative, a man able to match
wits with the world’s greatest spymaster—and win!
He must be highly skilled in all forms of combat, an
expert with every type of weapon. He must be tireless,
self-reliant, and prepared to give his life in the line of
duty, without warning and without regret. With these
qualities in mind, the Navy Department’s final choice
had fallen upon an already distinguished young officer—Commander
Don Winslow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not all of history’s great adventurers have looked
their parts; but Don Winslow in the ragged ruin of his
uniform whites was still a man to draw attention. The
lithe swing of his powerfully muscled body, from
shoulders to lean hips—the unconscious air of command
which marks a Navy officer—the clear, level
gaze and the strong line of his jaw—all stamped him as
a superb product of American birth and training.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington, Don’s inseparable companion, cut a
far less heroic figure. Except for gorilla-like strength
evident beneath his fat, the young lieutenant would
have resembled a chubby clown. Just now his naturally
tender skin was tortured by sunburn and insect bites to
the consistency of raw beef; yet its lumpy redness gave
an irresistible effect of comic makeup. Fortunately
Red’s own sense of humor was unconquerable and
almost as deep as his loyalty to Don Winslow. These
two traits, plus real ability as an officer and fighting
man, had won him the coveted job of Don’s most
trusted assistant, and the envy of every young naval
officer who preferred adventure to routine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Time and again, both Don Winslow and Red had
been marked for death by the secret organization of
Scorpia, whose war-making plots they had more than
once uncovered and wrecked. Their great hope was to
capture or destroy the crime ring’s despotic master—that
evil, elusive genius who called himself merely
“The Scorpion” and sucked in through a thousand
agents the war-poisoned wealth of nations. Wherever
war, or the fear of it, created topheavy armaments the
Scorpion’s brood took their fat share of graft and hush
money. War and murder were Scorpia’s stock in trade,
and to enlarge them its members’ perverted souls were
pledged.</p>

<p class='c009'>So great had the Scorpion’s secret power become
when the United States Government first realized its
danger, that only by a miracle could the threat of war
be lifted from our own and neighbor nations. In this
crisis Don Winslow was chosen to go out, like David
against the giant Goliath, and end the Scorpion’s
menace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Flying over the Windward Passage, Don and Red
finally spotted and bombed the Scorpion’s submarine
which had been torpedoing United States war vessels.
A short time later mysterious anti-aircraft fire brought
their plane down in the coastal jungle of Haiti. Neither
officer was hurt, however, and the gunners from the
Scorpion submarine base found the tables suddenly
turned when Don and Red surprised them and seized
their hidden stronghold. In the fight one Scorpion
agent was killed. The others escaped, under cover of
darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amazement struck the two young officers when they
discovered their close friend and childhood playmate,
Mercedes Colby, a prisoner in the enemy’s underground
quarters. Mercedes had blundered upon the
Scorpion base, after being shipwrecked on the wild
Haitian coast. With her had been taken prisoner a
Spanish-American, Yanos, two native fishermen, and
an ex-Navy seaman by the name of Jerry Ward.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the present moment all but Mercedes, Don and
Red were asleep in the immense underground tank
which the enemy had used as supply base and living
quarters. Knowing that the Commander had radioed
for a gunboat to pick them up, they took it for granted
that their troubles were over.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the three young persons now looking out
to sea knew better than to take anything for granted
where the evil power of Scorpia was involved. By this
time the failure of his men to report would have
warned the Scorpion that his submarine base was
captured. His counterattack might be delayed, but it
was certain to be deadly.</p>

<p class='c009'>With real relief therefore the two officers and Mercedes
recognized the trim lines of the United States
Gunboat <em>Gatoon</em>, just rounding a nearby headland. As
the converted yacht’s bower anchor splashed down at
the cove’s mouth, her launch swung outboard from the
davits, manned by a boatswain and two armed sailors.
At the same time a two-seater flying boat roared in out
of the dawn to land like a white gull in the offing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was quick answer to your radio call, Don!”
observed Red Pennington as the <em>Gatoon’s</em> launch drove
swiftly shoreward. “I didn’t count on their raising this
little jungle cove till noon. But, say! I sure hope Cap’n
Riggs has got more than Java and sinkers for breakfast!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow nodded, watching the launch’s bow
touch lightly on the white beach. It seemed that for a
little while the three of them could exchange dangers
and hardships for a well-earned rest aboard ship. The
Navy boatswain who had just leaped ashore was a
welcome symbol of America’s armed yet peace-loving
might, ready at all times to protect its loyal citizens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Answering the warrant officer’s salute, Don indicated
the anchored seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose craft is that?” he queried. “It’s not a Navy
boat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Mr. Splendor’s private plane, sir,” answered the
boatswain. “A young fellow called Panama is piloting
him. They spotted you at first crack of dawn and led
us in to this cove.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds like Michael Splendor!” exclaimed
Mercedes Colby. “He’s always one jump ahead of
everyone else in the Naval Intelligence. Except Don,
of course. The man is a wonder....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She broke off in alarm, as the drone of an approaching
airplane grew on the morning air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s another plane!” she cried, clutching at
Commander Winslow’s arm. “Don, do you think it
could be a Scorpion scout, coming back to investigate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It could be!” the young officer decided swiftly. “In
any case, this changes our plans. Boatswain! Shove off
at once in the launch with Miss Colby. Get her safely
aboard the gunboat and then come back. Lieutenant
Pennington and I will evacuate the other men from
the underground base. Hurry, Red!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned and raced up the beach, followed by the
stocky junior officer. Two minutes later he paused at
the rim of a huge steel cylinder whose bulk appeared to
be sunk deep in the earth. Thick jungle growth had
sprawled across the great tank’s top, hiding it completely
from the beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>One hand on the hatchway leading to the cylinder’s
interior, Don Winslow waited for his friend to catch
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What in thunder’s all the hurry, Don?” the red-headed
lieutenant gasped, stumbling through the
underbrush. “Even if that is a Scorpion plane up there,
it wouldn’t dare attack the gunboat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe not,” replied Don Winslow, jerking open
the hatch. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried
dropping a bomb on this secret base, now that we’ve
captured it. There’s a lot of priceless equipment here—new
gadgets of the Scorpion’s own invention. He’d
rather destroy that stuff than let us take it away. That’s
why I want to get every man out of here before it’s too
late!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A narrow steel ladder led down into the cylinder.
In the darkness, its slender rungs offered tricky footing,
but the two Navy men made short work of the
descent. Thirty feet below the hatchway, they reached
a dimly lighted landing, from which two doors opened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take the berth deck, Red,” Don directed curtly.
“Get Yanos and the two native fishermen out of their
hammocks and up the ladder. I’ll bring Jerry from the
chartroom. If he’s still unconscious I’ll carry him top-side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye-aye, Skipper!” muttered Red Pennington, pushing
through the left-hand door. “If you need any help,
just sing out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A short corridor led Don Winslow to the cylinder’s
crowded chartroom, where the seaman, Jerry Ward,
lay on a cot between two banks of electrical apparatus.
Don glanced with envious eyes at the array of super-sensitive
instruments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only we had time to get some of this stuff aboard
the gunboat!” he muttered. “No time to think about
that now, though. That plane overhead may lay an
'egg’ on this place any minute!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bending over the unconscious Jerry, he shook the
man gently. There was no response. A head wound,
received at the time of his capture, had left the plucky
fellow hanging between life and death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carefully Don lifted the limp body in his arms and
turned to the door. As he did so, a muffled explosion
shook the steel walls about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bursting out onto the lower landing, Don Winslow
collided with Lieutenant Pennington.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quick, Red!” he barked. “Take Jerry on your back,
and get up that ladder. I’ll lash his wrists together, so
you’ll have both hands free to climb with. Where are
Yanos and the others?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve just gone up!” Red answered, stooping to
take Jerry’s weight. “And say! That <em>did</em> sound like a
bomb overhead, just now! We’d better get out of here
in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right!” grunted Don, pushing the other toward the
ladder. “You take Jerry up and get him down to the
boat. I’ve got a little job to do before I follow you; so
don’t wait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Don!” protested the red-haired officer. “I can’t
leave you here....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On your way, Lieutenant!” snapped the young
commander. “Obey orders and get that seaman down to
the boat. Lively, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Talking to himself in a bitter undertone, Red Pennington
toiled up the ladder with his heavy burden.
He’d obey those orders, all right, but Don hadn’t forbidden
him to return after seeing Jerry safely in the
boat. If his commanding officer was going to stick
around where the bombs were dropping, a certain
husky lieutenant meant to share the danger with him!</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime, Don Winslow had returned to the chartroom,
and was hastily disconnecting the main electric
cables leading to the Scorpion’s weather mapping
machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The invention was priceless, if it could be salvaged.
Heavy as it was, Don thought he might be able to
carry it up the ladder.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he worked, with flashlight and screwdriver,
wrench and pliers, two more bomb explosions shook
the underground base.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little by little, a stifling, smoky odor filled the air of
the chartroom. Tears filled Don’s smarting eyes, inflamed
by the acrid fumes. His breath came raspingly
between dry coughs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reluctantly he dropped his tools and fumbled for
the doorknob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those were <em>gas</em> bombs, not TNT!” he mumbled
thickly, as he stumbled from the room. “Smoke’s coming
down the hatch. Got to get up where there’s some—uh—air
to breathe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he groped toward the ladder a bulky form
emerged from the smoke above him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don! Don, old man!” came Red Pennington’s
choking cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right here, Red!” coughed Don Winslow, clinging
to the ladder’s lower rungs. “I’m—uh—all right.
Coming up now. But you shouldn’t have come back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank heaven, you’re okay!” the redhead replied.
“Want me to give you a hand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! I’ll make it. Hustle, now, or the smoke is going
to—uh—get us both! Where’re Mercedes and Jerry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pennington’s answer was a coughing fit, which
shook the steel ladder. Just below him, Don Winslow
gripped the narrow rungs and gasped for breath. After
a moment the two men resumed their painful climb,
fighting against a growing dizziness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercedes—Jerry—on the beach!” came Red’s muffled
words. “Smoke too thick to see—see the boat. Got
to save breath now, and—uh—climb!”</p>

  <h2 id='chII' class='c010'>II<br /> <br /><i>OUT OF THE POISON FOG</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Over the jungle cove rolled an unbroken cloud of
billowing, greenish smoke. It blotted out the white
beach, spread out over the blue water, and crept slowly
outward toward the anchored gunboat.</p>

<p class='c009'>From its murky edge came the roar of powerful
engines. The seaplane’s nose emerged from the poisonous
smoke, slid swiftly over the waves, and rose like a
great white gull into the clear upper air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aboard the gunboat, steam winches began weighing
the two anchors, while officers and seamen hurried to
batten down hatches and close ventilators. Slowly the
craft’s sharp bow swung seaward. Her twin propellors
churned white water at her stern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither the launch nor its erstwhile occupants could
be seen beneath that greenish cloud of poison gas.
In vain the seaplane’s pilot circled the big airship over
the jungle’s edge, looking for a break in the smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fly lower, Panama!” commanded the hard-jawed
man in the after cockpit. “If that stuff thins, even for
a moment, we may be able to spot somebody. There’s
eleven souls down there, at death’s door for all we
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s where we’ll be, Mr. Splendor, if the gas hits
us!” replied the pilot. “But here goes.... Look! The
wind’s made a rift in the cloud! There’s the launch,
and a couple of men sprawled beside it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drop landing gear!” cried Splendor, as the plane’s
nose dipped earthward. “Land in the cove and taxi
right up onto the beach. We must get those poor fellows
to the gunboat or die trying!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a quick nod, Panama cut the throttle. An instant
later the seaplane’s pontoons touched the water
in a flash of white spray. Straight into the thinning gas
cloud the ship plunged, heading for the level beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>To anxious watchers aboard the gunboat, it looked
as if Michael Splendor and his plucky pilot had committed
deliberate suicide. Unable to see the rift which
Panama had spotted from the air, they waited in agonized
suspense for the plane’s reappearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Captain Riggs raised a pointing arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the plane, now, but something’s wrong,
Lieutenant!” he exclaimed, to the junior officer beside
him. “See how low she rides in the water! And what
under the sun are those dark blotches on the forward
fuselage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peering through his binoculars, Lieutenant Darnley
cried out in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re men, Captain!” he reported. “Mr. Splendor
is holding two of them, and there’s another in his cockpit.
All three look to be unconscious, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lower the whaleboat!” bellowed Riggs, leaning
over the bridge’s rail. “Stand by to take men off the
seaplane. Darnley, tell the medical officer to prepare
berths in the sick bay. I’m going in the boat myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Moments later the seaplane’s crew gave up their
helpless passengers to the whaleboat. Michael Splendor,
his eyes streaming with tears from the poison gas
fumes, insisted on going back at once for another rescue
attempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve still to find the main shore party, Captain!”
he explained between gasps for breath. “There’s young
Winslow and Pennington still to be found, not to forget
Admiral Colby’s daughter. Every second will count
if we’re to save their lives!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, Mr. Splendor!” agreed Riggs, balancing
in the whaleboat’s sternsheets. “We’ll follow you
inshore, as soon as we get these poor fellows aboard.
The smoke looks to be thinning now. Good luck!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His words were drowned out by the roar of the seaplane’s
motors. Like a huge water bird she taxied
around, heading back to the beach. At the same
moment, the boat’s oarsmen gave way with short
powerful strokes that sped them toward the waiting
ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once alongside, the boat falls were made fast by expert
hands, and the whaleboat was lifted dripping from
the water. Even before the gassed seamen were transferred
to the sick bay, the ship was nosing shoreward
to join in the next desperate attempt at rescuing Don
Winslow and his gallant companions.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>Many hours later a westering sun cast its mellow rays
through the portholes of the gunboat <em>Gatoon</em>, now a
floating hospital anchored off the coast of Haiti. In
the vessel’s sick bay, a white-coated medical officer bent
frowning over one of the ten occupied berths. So intently
was he watching the patient that he failed to
hear the door open, or see the approach of the big man
in the wheelchair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought this is where I’d find you, Doctor!” exclaimed
the latter, his tone warm with a touch of Irish
brogue. “They told me the seaman, Jerry, is sinking
fast!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young doctor turned with a shake of his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s in pretty bad shape, Mr. Splendor,” he said
wearily. “The others are coming around surprisingly
well, though. Even the girl, Miss Colby. I expect Commander
Winslow and Lieutenant Pennington will regain
consciousness this evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just fine, Doctor!” exclaimed Splendor heartily.
“Do ye mind if I go along when next ye look in on
’em. Even with me crippled legs, I promise not to be
in the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along, of course, Mr. Splendor,” smiled the
medical officer, opening the door. “If you and your
seaplane had been OUT of the way this morning, none
of these men would be alive now. You’re pretty much
of a hero on this ship, whether you know it or not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean my pilot, Panama!” growled the big
man, rolling his chair along the steel deck. “It was him
who did the rescuing, while I sat helpless in me cockpit....
Ah! So this is the cabin where ye put Don
Winslow and his redheaded mate, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a nod, the doctor threw open the cabin door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They seem to be still asleep, both of them,” he
murmured, glancing across the narrow room. “Here!
I’ll help you with that chair, if you’d like to come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Low pitched as they were, the words registered on
Don Winslow’s slumbering senses. He stirred, opened
his eyes, and struggled up on one elbow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Michael Splendor!” he exclaimed huskily. “I
dreamed about you, and a seaplane, and a cloud of
poison smoke and.... Say! Where are we, anyhow?
And what am I doing in this cabin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rolling his chair swiftly to the side of the berth,
Michael Splendor held up a big hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisht, and be quiet, young feller-me-lad!” he
rumbled. “It was no dream ye had about the poison
smoke. Ye’re still sick from it, so take it easy. Your
mate, the redheaded lieutenant, is sleepin’ in the next
berth to ye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not, Don!” croaked Red Pennington, trying to
sit up. “I was lying low so as not to wake you! Oh-h-h!
Golly! Does my head hurt!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be worse if you don’t lie down, Pennington!”
snapped the medical officer. “If you and Commander
Winslow didn’t have leather lungs and cast iron constitutions,
we’d be sewing you up in canvas right now,
for a sea burial. You two got the biggest dose of
smoke!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Mercedes—I mean, Miss Colby—she must have
been gassed too!” cried Don Winslow, from the other
berth. “Is she coming out of it yet, Doctor? Tell me the
truth....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, lad!” soothed Splendor, pushing the young
officer back onto his pillow. “Miss Colby’s out of danger,
so don’t excite yourself. We got Yanos and the
two fishermen in time, too, along with the launch’s
crew. Ye’ll hear all the details tomorrow, when you’re
feelin’ stronger. The doctor and I will be leavin’ ye
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—the underground base!” muttered Don
weakly, pressing a hand to his aching eyes. “About that
apparatus, and the automatic weather map—Tell me,
Splendor....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll talk about that another time,” said the man
in the wheel chair. “There’s nothing to worry about,
except the strength ye’re wastin’ this minute, Commander.
So pipe down and give your thoughts a rest
till ye’re called on deck. The same goes for you, Pennington,
d’ye hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye-aye, sir!” came the redhead’s mumbled response,
as the cabin door closed softly behind the
visitors.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c010'>III<br /> <br /><i>HIGH EXPLOSIVE</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Dawn had just broken the following day when
Don Winslow sat up on the edge of his berth. There
was a light of determination in his eye, and a fighting
set to his unshaven jaw.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was going to get up, shave and dress before the
ship’s doctor had a chance to forbid him. He was tired
of lying in a berth. Most of all, he was anxious to see
for himself if Mercedes and the others were really getting
over the effects of the poison gas.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were some difficulties to be met, of course. In
the first place, his head was still woozy, and the deck
heaved up and down as if in heavy weather. In the
second place, someone had taken away his torn and
muddy uniform. If he could get to the locker in the
corner, though, he might find something to put on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Groping his way along the bulkhead, Don reached
the locker and jerked open the door. There, as he had
hoped, hung an officer’s spare uniform, along with a
dress sword, weapon belt and other equipment. A
drawer beneath contained underwear, shaving kit, and
towels.</p>

<p class='c009'>The set-up was complete, including a hot water tap
in another corner of the cabin. If only Red didn’t wake
up, or the doctor come in before he was dressed....</p>

<p class='c009'>Fifteen minutes later Don was buttoning up his
borrowed tunic, when a sudden yell and a thump spun
him around in alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sufferin’ sea serpents!” gurgled the voice of Red
Pennington.</p>

<p class='c009'>More muffled groans, grunts and howls for help
issued from the tangle of bedclothes under Red’s berth.
Don came to the rescue, laughing so hard that he
almost lost his footing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boy! You sure hit the deck in a hurry!” he
chuckled, unwinding a sheet from around his stocky
friend’s neck. “What were you dreaming about, anyway,
to make you yell like that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A-argh! Umph!” groaned Red, feeling of his chafed
neck. “It’s no laughing matter, if you want to know it!
I dreamed the Scorpion’s men were hanging me to the
yardarm, and you came along just in time to cut me
down. What if it <em>was</em> only a sheet instead of a rope?
That dream was real enough!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It probably was,” agreed Don Winslow, his grin
fading. “I had nightmares aplenty myself. It must be
the effects of that poison wearing off. You’ll feel better
if you get up and shave, Red. Unfortunately, I have
on the only uniform in the cabin....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately is right,—if you refer to the fit!”
cut in the fat lieutenant sourly as he got to his feet.
“That tunic you’ve got on was built for a man of
ample girth. Like me, for instance! And as for the
pants—Whee-ew! Don’t let the wind catch ’em unfurled,
when you go topside, Commander! That’s all
I say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’ll be enough, too, Lieutenant. At least until
I get my own clothes back!” retorted Don, moving
over to the open porthole. “Anyhow, this suit covers
me better than—Whoa, there! Careful, sailor! Those
knees of yours are going to buckle right under you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Catching Red’s arm, Don Winslow steadied him just
in time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where were you going to walk to, shipmate?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pennington’s reply was shaky, despite his plucky
grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Across to that chair and then collapse!” he
answered. “Boy, oh, boy—this room’s going around!
I’m weak as a baby. Hope it’ll pass off before Doc
orders me back to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hope so, Red!” replied Don, easing his friend into
the chair. “We’ll just sit here and talk for a few minutes.
You know, I wish Headquarters hadn’t ordered
us to destroy the Scorpion’s base, here. I hate to blow
up all the machinery there that’s too heavy to move.
If only I had another month to study those new inventions!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Okay, Commander!” chuckled Red Pennington.
“Why don’t you dig up the whole underground base
and take it along as a souvenir? That’d be just as
reasonable as—Say, listen, Skipper! You ought to be
more than satisfied with what you’ve done already.
Wasn’t it you that found the Scorpion’s base, to begin
with? And who else but Don Winslow discovered how
our ships were destroyed, here in the Windward Passage?
It was you, more than anybody else, who pulled
the last trick of sinking the Scorpion’s submarine.
What more do you want, to be happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow turned to gaze out of the porthole at
the sunlit waves of the cove. Beyond stretched the
white sand beach, now swarming with sailors in dungarees.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Gatoon’s</em> launch and two whaleboats were
pulled up at the edge of the water. Don guessed that
they were getting ready to blow up the great steel
cylinder buried at the jungle’s edge. In a few hours, at
most, the gunboat would be weighing anchor, bound
for the safety of civilized ports.</p>

<p class='c009'>Which was all as it should be; and yet....</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the truth has to be told, Red,” the young commander
said softly, “I’ll never be satisfied until I nab
the biggest prize of all—the Scorpion himself. Anything
less than wiping out that menace to world peace,
falls short of victory. You know how deeply I feel
about that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do; and you’re not alone in that feeling!” responded
Pennington earnestly. “But remember, Skipper,
the capture of the Scorpion is nearer today than
it was six months ago. Through <em>your</em> efforts his secret
organization is now on the defensive—almost on the
run. I may not be a prophet or anything like that, but
I’ll bet my life that within six months’ time you’ll have
the Scorpion across the table from you—a prisoner!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long moment Don Winslow gazed straight
into his friend’s eager face. Red’s praise, his confidence,
his enthusiasm, were all exaggerated, perhaps. All the
same they meant a lot just at this time. The young
commander’s chest expanded with a sigh of unspoken
gratitude to this loyal friend and shipmate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re sure a grand tonic, Red, old man!” he
smiled. “I hope your prediction comes true, to the letter.
But we’ve got to do something more than just
hope and wish, you know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do know, Don!” replied the chubby officer soberly.
“And I’ve been doing a lot of thinking in the last few
hours. There’s an idea that came to me last night.
Maybe you’ll say it’s all crazy, but....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crazy ideas are sometimes the best, after all, Red,”
Don encouraged, as Pennington hesitated. “Let’s have
it, anyhow. We can’t afford to overlook any bets in
this man’s game, so shoot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington wriggled uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—all right. You asked for it, so don’t laugh!”
he blurted finally. “It’s just this: you know enough
right now to pass yourself off as one of the Scorpion’s
agents. You actually did it, for a short while, the time
we barged in on Shilling and the Shark,—remember?
Why couldn’t you do it again, and make it stick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow took a turn up and down the cabin’s
narrow space, frowning as he chewed mentally on
Red’s suggestion. Bringing up before his friend’s chair,
he shook his head smilingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t do, shipmate,” he stated. “In the first
place, we’d have to capture some member of Scorpia
who looked enough like me to make my disguise and
substitution possible. Next, I’d have to find a way to
open that man’s mind out flat, and memorize everything
he knew. It’s all very well to dream about, but
you know yourself such breaks only come once in a
lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless you make ’em, Skipper!” returned the
stocky lieutenant, pushing himself up to his feet. “For
instance, you could get yourself kicked out of the Navy—dishonorably
discharged—stripped of your commission—disgraced
publicly before your shipmates. Suppose
you did that, and were determined to get revenge
on the Navy for breaking you. Just where, then, would
you be most likely to turn for help? Answer me, Don!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For ten seconds the young commander stood gaping
in stark amazement at the wildness of Red Pennington’s
scheme. Slowly his expression changed to a boyish
grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I get you now, Red!” he said admiringly. “For
sheer, crazy daring, your idea takes the cake. It’s fantastic,
goofy, impossible, and yet—the more I think
about it the more it grows on me, sailor! We’ll talk it
over with Michael Splendor in any case, and see....”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sudden leap, Don Winslow cleared the space
to the cabin door and yanked it violently open. A
crouched figure outside dodged back, ducking around
a corner. The officer sprang after him, only to trip and
go sprawling in the “cabin country” just outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ruefully he got to his feet and re-entered the door,
closing it after him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks as if that poison gas left my legs kind of
wobbly, too!” he grumbled, seating himself on his
berth. “I almost caught Mr. Snooper at that. But, Red!
You see what this means? <em>There’s at least one Scorpion
spy aboard this vessel!</em> He probably got an earful of our
conversation, too, and....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“BOO-OOM! BR-ROM-BOOM!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The heavy explosions came from somewhere inshore.
Red Pennington leaped from his chair to join Don
Winslow at the cabin’s porthole. They were in time to
see a huge mushroom of earth and water rise high over
the jungle at the edge of the little cove.</p>

<p class='c009'>Closer to the ship, and traveling nearer at appalling
speed, rose a low wall of water—a miniature tidal
wave created by the blast. As it struck the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
port bow, the decks tilted crazily, like those of a toy
boat. After the wave had passed there came a dull
roar of water rushing into a vast crater in the cove’s
white beach.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The underground base!” breathed Red, clinging
weakly to the porthole. “They’ve blown it up, Don,
along with all that machinery the Scorpion’s agents left
behind!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c010'>IV<br /> <br /><i>THE CODE MESSAGE</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Stepping back, Don Winslow stared at his friend
aghast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not everything—not ALL the machinery, I hope,
Red!” he groaned. “Man alive! The Scorpion’s weather
mapping machine alone was a priceless invention. If
they’ve blown that up—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They didn’t, Commander, so put your mind at
rest!” interrupted the rich brogue of Michael Splendor
from the doorway. “I hope you’ll forgive me for
wheelin’ in on ye unexpected, gentlemen. What with
the explosions and the pitchin’ of the ship in that tidal
wave, 'tis no wonder ye didn’t hear me knock!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow turned to grip the crippled man’s big
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll forgive you, Mr. Splendor,” he smiled, “provided
you tell us what’s been happening ashore since
yesterday. By the looks of the gang on the beach, a little
while ago, there was a lot of work going on—more
than just laying a dynamite charge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was indeed!” nodded Splendor. “Captain
Riggs’ lads have been workin’ the whole night tryin’
to salvage the machines of the Scorpion’s invention.
They’ve got most of them aboard ship now, includin’
your precious weather map. What they blew up just
now was little more than an empty shell. I came in
especially to tell ye that, and to bring ye this bundle
before the doctor comes in to bother ye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a broad wink, the big man produced a large
package from under the blanket which covered his
crippled legs. Ripping off the paper wrapping, he disclosed
a pair of officer’s uniforms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had to guess at the sizes when I borrowed them,
lads,” he chuckled, “but they should fit better than
what ye’re wearin’ at present. Look under the after
part of me wheel chair for another bundle of shirts,
shoes, and whatnot. Ye see, I thought if the doctor saw
ye both dressed and about the decks he’d not have the
heart to order ye back to bed. I know how hard it is for
an active man to be kept on his back when there’s work
to do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow took the package of clothing in wordless
gratitude. Somehow, this middle aged cripple’s
thoughtfulness touched him more deeply than he could
express.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Pennington’s pleasure, however, was quite
outspoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a lifesaver, Mr. Splendor!” he cried, seizing
the bundle out of Don’s hands. “I’d have died of shame
if I’d had to finish this voyage in a bathrobe and pajamas.
I feel a hundred per cent better already. Just
wait till I get these on....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What news of Miss Colby, and the seaman Jerry?”
asked Don, as Red retreated behind the locker door.
“That is, if it’s not too early for the doctor’s report.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re both on the mend,” replied Splendor, his
blue eyes twinkling. “Especially the young lady. Her
cabin door was open as I came by, and I heard her
askin’ the medical officer when you would be well
enough to take her for a stroll on deck! But that isn’t
all the news I have to tell ye, Commander. Lieutenant
Darnley brought back a bundle of papers from the
chartroom of the underground base. Unless my old
eyes deceive me, there’s one item among them the
Scorpion would prefer we didn’t know about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don, seated on the edge of his berth, leaned forward
tensely, his eyes alight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great work, Mr. Splendor!” he exclaimed. “Red
Pennington and I went through those papers in a
hurry without finding a thing of interest. What was it
you picked out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A mere bit of paper tucked away in a small notebook,”
answered the cripple, fumbling in a pocket of
his loose coat. “'Tis no wonder ye overlooked it; but
with me nose for smellin’ out secret codes, I was suspicious
of the thing immediately. Now, then—here it
is! An innocent-looking message, is it not? But with
the code key right there in the notebook, it becomes
something else entirely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington, now dressed in a fresh shirt and
trousers which fitted him surprisingly well, edged up
to the wheel chair. His eyes were fairly popping with
curiosity and excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G-golly!” he said huskily. “To think we both had
this note in our hands, and never suspected anything
queer! Mind if I look over your shoulder, Don?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Read it aloud, Lieutenant!” urged Michael Splendor,
glancing up with a nod.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington bent closer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“'Proceed with original contract,’” he read, “'for delivery
October or not later than the first of the year.
We will expect San Francisco order on schedule as this
Empire contact is highly important. Our telegraph
operator advises that many messages suggest Cho-San
as the ideal sales name for our delightful produce
which suggests China Seas and that catchy name brings
orders.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, Don!” the red-haired lieutenant commented.
“If that’s in code, it’s a loo-loo! Sounds just like an ordinary
business letter, or something!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, so it does!” chuckled Michael Splendor.
“But there’s the catch. Ye note that the message is
typed in five word lines. Very well, take this pencil
and cross out all but the first word in the first line, the
second word in the second line, and so on through the
fifth. At the sixth line begin again with the first word.
When ye’ve finished, read me what ye have left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a low whistle of comprehension, Don Winslow
took the pencil and, stepping over to the cabin’s
desk, swiftly made the indicated changes. A few seconds
later, he read off slowly the words which
remained:</p>

<p class='c009'>“'Proceed—October—first—San Francisco—Empire—contact—Operator—Cho-San—for—China Seas—orders.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll be keelhauled!” blurted Red Pennington.
“That’s a Scorpion message, all right. It sounds plain
enough, too, except for the word 'Empire’ and 'Cho-San.’
Do they make any sense to you, Mr. Splendor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man in the wheel chair did not reply. While
Don had been decoding the message, the cripple had
moved his rubber tired vehicle over to the porthole. He
was now gazing out at the sunlit shore line, with an
expression of grim thoughtfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following the man’s look, Don gave a start of amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, the shore seems to be moving!” he exclaimed.
“I didn’t realize the ship was under way, did you,
Red? We were both so interested in this code message.
Where are we bound, Mr. Splendor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a quick movement, the big man whirled his
chair about, and faced the two young officers. His
broad, lined face had the look of a person just waking
from a heavy sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, gentlemen!” he said apologetically. “I’m
afraid me mind was far away when ye spoke. The
name 'Cho-San’ recalled things I’d like to forget, if
this broken body of mine would let me. But this is no
time to talk of me own troubles! Ye asked where we
were bound, did ye not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Don’s silent nod, Michael Splendor’s mood underwent
another swift change. His strikingly blue eyes
lighted with their irresistible smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re steerin’ for Port-au-Prince,” he stated. “'Tis
meself persuaded Captain Riggs to put us ashore there
for a few days, while we’re waitin’ fresh orders from
Washington. I’ve a big, cool, country residence of me
own near the city, where ye and Miss Colby will be
more than welcome to stay and recover ye’re full health.
Don’t refuse, now, and disappoint an old shut-in who
has little to live for except his friends!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry!” laughed Don Winslow, exchanging
glances with Red. “We’ve heard plenty about your
famous country house, Mr. Splendor, and we’re not refusing!
It’s more like a palace than an ordinary dwelling,
I understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s fine, Commander,” said Splendor, wheeling
himself around toward the door. “And now, if ye’ll
just hand me that code letter from the desk, I’ll be
shovin’ off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington stepped over to the desk, only to
stand staring in blank surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The paper—are you sure you left it here, Don?” he
asked, stooping to search the deck beneath. “I’d swear
you didn’t pick it up again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a puzzled exclamation, Don Winslow joined
him in a hunt for the missing letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every scrap of paper on the desk was examined;
every inch of the desk’s interior was covered. Don’s
own pockets were turned inside out. Frowning, Don
turned to Michael Splendor, who had been watching
them in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to have vanished!” he declared helplessly.
“That letter just isn’t here; and yet, there’s no place it
could have gone....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be too sure, Commander!” said the cripple,
calmly pointing to the half-open door. “It <em>could</em> have
gone that way, with no more trouble than a sneak
thief would take to lift it. There were several minutes,
ye mind, when none of us was watching that side of
the cabin. 'Tis me own fault, for I should have been on
guard. Not even a Government vessel is safe from
Scorpion spies!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c010'>V<br /> <br /><i>STRUCK DOWN FROM BEHIND</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Like a picture ship on a blue enameled sea, the gunboat
<em>Gatoon</em> steamed quietly on her way. Not even a
ground swell disturbed the level of her white decks, or
raised an extra dash of spray from her cutwater.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet storm and violence, in human form, were already
aboard her. Within the vessel’s narrow confines, loyal
officers and citizens of a great nation were pitted
against the unknown agents of a fiendish power. Each
side now stood on its guard, ready for the battle to
open; but when or where the first blow would be
struck, only the Scorpion himself could tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strain of waiting was hardest, of course, upon
Don and his friends, who at this moment were gathered
under an awning on the <em>Gatoon’s</em> after deck. They
knew that one or more of Scorpia’s agents were on
board, disguised no doubt as members of the gunboat’s
enlisted crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were aware that the enemy would stop at nothing—not
even at destroying the ship with every living
soul—if that could be accomplished. Yet they were
helpless to do a thing until trouble showed itself in
visible form.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow, standing by the after rail, had just
finished telling about the spy he had almost caught
listening at his cabin door. That incident fitted perfectly
with the theft of Michael Splendor’s decoded letter.
Unfortunately, the brief glimpse Don had had of the
skulker was not enough to identify him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All I saw,” he admitted, in response to Captain
Riggs’ query, “was a man’s white clad arm and shoulder
disappearing around the corner of the bulkhead.
It didn’t look like a seaman’s blouse!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean, it might have been an officer’s, Don?”
cried Mercedes Colby, leaning forward in her deck
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or a petty officer’s or even a cabin steward’s,” responded
the young commander. “That really isn’t much
to go on in naming a suspect, you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure, Winslow,” said Captain Riggs stiffly, “that
every commissioned officer here aboard is above suspicion.
As for the enlisted personnel, of course, I can’t
be sure. There were some replacements made in the
crew before we shoved off from Guantanamo, and a
spy might have come aboard with them. About the
only thing we can do is to check their enlistment records.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The very idea I was about to suggest!” agreed
Michael Splendor. “Suppose you and Commander Winslow
look through the papers now, Captain, and let us
know what you find. Meantime, Lieutenant Pennington
and I will try to entertain Miss Colby. We’ll meet
again at mess, this evening, if nothing happens before
then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Don and the captain had gone below, the man
in the wheel chair turned his keen blue eyes on the two
young people beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes, me friends,” he said earnestly, “I have a
hunch that some great thing is going to happen. And
happen it does, despite every circumstance against it.
In this case me hunch is that the Scorpion’s power will
be broken, and himself a prisoner, six months from this
very day!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A low whistle from Red Pennington greeted Splendor’s
statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But those were almost my own words to Don this
morning!” the stocky lieutenant exclaimed. “Thanks to
Don Winslow, we’ve matched every move the enemy
has made with a better one. The Scorpion must be
desperate, right now. And desperation usually goes before
a flop, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very often, it does,” replied Michael Splendor cautiously.
“But I’m afraid the Scorpion is more angry than
desperate at this moment, for all the damage we have
done him. 'Tis rather because of that code letter, and
the opening it gives us, that I’m so hopeful of success.
As you recall, it tells us there is to be a meeting of
Scorpia members in San Francisco, with Cho-San himself
in charge!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who,” asked Mercedes Colby, as Splendor
paused, “is this person you call Cho-San?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more a look of gloomy absorption had spread
across the crippled man’s features. His eyes, gazing
outboard upon the sunlit Caribbean, had the look of a
sleepwalker’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San,” he murmured, “is a chosen member of
the inner circle of Scorpia. It was he and his evil master,
the Scorpion, who made me the cripple I am today.
'Twas their devilish torture, in the chamber of horrors
they call the Dragon Room....”</p>

<p class='c009'>A shudder gripped the big, helpless body of Michael
Splendor, cutting off his strange speech. When it had
passed, he sighed and blinked rapidly, like a man awaking
from a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was I speaking about? Ah, yes, I remember!”
he said in a stronger voice. “Cho-San is the Scorpion
agent in charge of all war-provoking operations from
San Francisco to Singapore. Any meeting which he
calls among Scorpia’s members is of the utmost importance.
It means a fresh attempt to stir up war among
civilized nations, so that, from the wreckage of human
lives and fortunes, the Scorpion may pick more bloodstained
wealth and power. The Naval Intelligence
knows all that, but we need legal evidence before we
can trap the archcriminal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see what you mean now, sir!” put in Red excitedly.
“You’re hoping that Don Winslow may be able to horn
in on that secret meeting in some way. If he could do
that, he’d get the evidence you need!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Splendor’s nod of assent, Mercedes Colby caught
her breath sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But wouldn’t such an attempt be horribly dangerous?”
she protested. “Just supposing they caught Don
eavesdropping, or present in disguise—what chance
would he have of getting out alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very little, I am afraid,” replied the man in the
wheel chair. “But remember, my dear, the United
States Navy is a fighting service, where men and officers
expect to risk their lives in the cause of peace.
Look! Here comes Captain Riggs, and he seems to be
in a hurry. Perhaps he has news....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain took the short ladder to the yacht’s poop
deck in two leaps. His expression showed both worry
and anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lieutenant Pennington!” he clipped out harshly.
“I’m afraid you’re needed below, in my cabin. Commander
Winslow....”</p>

<p class='c009'>He paused, biting his lip as if at a loss for further
speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, sir!” prompted Red in a strained voice.
“What’s happened to Don? Has he been taken sick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s been attacked!” blurted Riggs. “Struck down
from behind and then chloroformed. The doctor is
with him now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red waited for no more. Forgotten were gassed lungs
and wobbly knees as he plunged down the ladder and
dived into the cabin country, several jumps ahead of
Riggs himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moments later Splendor and Mercedes Colby joined
the anxious little group. Don Winslow was sitting up
in the Captain’s swivel chair, looking decidedly “green
around the gills.” The ship’s doctor was binding a compress
about his head; and, despite the draft through
open door and skylight, the whole cabin smelled of
chloroform.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you people will have to tell me what happened,”
the young commander was mumbling. “One
minute I was looking through a pile of enlistment records—and
the next, I was lying on the deck under the
table, and feeling sick as a pup! What fell on me, anyhow,
Doc?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A piece of lead pipe, to judge by the swelling,”
growled the medical officer. “Someone wanted to put
you to sleep in a hurry, and keep you that way. He
used chloroform after slugging you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sure came out of it in a hurry, though, Don!”
laughed Red Pennington, rather shakily. “I’d no sooner
picked you up off the deck than you up and socked me
in the eye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m still slug-nutty; so you’d better watch out, Mercedes!”
grinned Don, taking the glass of water the girl
handed him. “But, seriously, I’d like to know who
downed me, and why. Have you any idea, Captain
Riggs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Commander,” answered the officer gloomily. “I
believe it was a brutal attempt at murder by some one
of the enlisted personnel. I shall do my best to hunt
the scoundrel down before we reach port. Meantime, I
can only blame myself for leaving you alone. If I had
not returned when I did....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t take it that way, Captain!” protested Don
Winslow, earnestly. “You weren’t to blame. And as for
the notion of a murder attempt—wouldn’t a killer have
used something surer than a blackjack and chloroform?
Those things are a thief’s weapons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly, Commander!” spoke the deep voice of
Michael Splendor. “Ye’ve named the means and the
motive all in the same breath. A theft it was, to be sure;
and if ye’ll just glance about the place, ye’ll see quick
enough what the rascal stole.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A startled silence fell upon the other five persons in
the cabin. It was broken when Don, struggling up from
his chair, cried sharply:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The enlistment records! They’re gone, the whole
stack of them!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c010'>VI<br /> <br /><i>MURDER BELOW DECKS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One mystery had been solved, but it had given rise to
a more sinister problem. Michael Splendor was the one
who pointed this out, as Don Winslow and his friends
sat that evening at the officers’ mess.</p>

<p class='c009'>How, he asked, could the thief have known Don was
making a search of the enlistment records?</p>

<p class='c009'>There were various answers offered on the spur of
the moment. Mercedes Colby suggested that Don and
the captain had been overheard talking about it on
their way to the cabin; but that point was quickly settled.
Neither man had mentioned it before reaching
Riggs’ cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red’s answer was that the thief had happened to see
Don through the open door, as he sat at the captain’s
table. This sounded reasonable, until Michael Splendor
told them he had tried looking through the door. From
outside the cabin, he stated, neither table nor record file
could be seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The conclusion is, me friends,” he said with a
troubled frown, “that the man who struck down Commander
Winslow knew in advance what he was going
to do, and why. He had time to plan the job, and wait
for his chance to catch his victim alone. <em>He knew the</em>
<em>very moment we decided to search those records for a
clue!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the shocked silence which followed Splendor’s
words, Riggs pushed back his chair. The captain’s face
had the look of a man just charged with murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In other words, you accuse me, Mr. Splendor!” he
said hoarsely, rising to his feet. “By George, sir! If you
were not a cripple, I would....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Captain Riggs!” the voice of Michael Splendor
rang sharp as a trumpet call. “I am accusing no one
of us—least of all yourself. Now, look me in the eye
and smile, me friend; for in faith I would sooner accuse
meself than anyone in this cabin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly the color came back into Captain Riggs’
cheeks. Sinking back into his chair at the head of the
table, he did his best to smile, though it was a hard
attempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you, Mr. Splendor!” he said huskily. “But
the way you put the evidence gave me an ugly start,
sir. It seemed to point to me alone as the attacker, or
at least as the one person whose whereabouts were unaccounted
for at the time of the attack on Winslow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed it did, Captain,” admitted the man in the
wheel chair, apologetically, “and sorry I am for not
choosing me words more carefully! I was just tryin’ to
show all of ye how closely we are being spied upon. I
meself could have sworn that no one was in earshot of
our party this afternoon. Yet our every speech was
heard and noted by the enemy. Our future plans must
be told in whispers behind locked doors, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout the rest of the meal there was a lively
argument about dictaphones and other means of eavesdropping
which the spy might have used. It all proved
highly amusing to the Scorpion spy, who was listening
in on every word, by the aid of a clever electrical “ear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Small and easily concealed as a man’s wrist watch,
the device was a powerful amplifier of ordinary sounds.
These were transmitted over threadlike wires to an earphone,
palmed in the spy’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turned toward a ship’s ventilator or porthole, or
toward a party conversing on deck, the mechanical
“ear” could pick up even whispered speech without
the slightest difficulty.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while this comparatively harmless eavesdropping
was in progress, a far more sinister drama was being
enacted below decks. It was the old, old game of
death, which has been played since life began upon the
earth, and the first killer stalked his unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Deep in the bowels of the ship, amid the click and
whir of oiled machinery, Chief Petty Officer Ahern
began his evening watch. He was a man of about
thirty years, with a well-muscled body, and keen, blue
Irish eyes. In six years he had risen from Fireman
Second Class to Chief Machinist’s Mate.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the moment, Ahern was the only man in the
engine room of the <em>Gatoon</em>. Lieutenant Allen, the Engineer
Officer, was in his own stateroom, cleaning up
for the evening meal. The other Machinist’s Mates were
off watch. The nearest members of the “black gang”
were sweating in the boiler room, forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ahern was whistling an old Irish ditty as he moved
about, checking the smoothly running machinery.
Thought of danger was the farthest thing from his
mind as he paused to glance up at the stars shining
through the fiddley hatch above his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once his body stiffened as if in agony. His
hands clawed at his throat. Mouth open and eyes popping
from their sockets, he reeled backward in a grotesque
dance of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he fell, struggling, to the iron deck, a man in
ordinary seaman’s uniform dodged past him toward
the main steam line. There was a quick sharp hammering;
a hiss of escaping steam. Then the seaman reappeared,
his features covered by a white handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Briefly he stooped over Ahern’s limp body, fumbling
at the swollen, purple neck. The next moment, swift as
a startled rat, he slipped out of sight behind a bulkhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Five minutes later, Lieutenant Allen came on deck
for a breath of air before going to mess. Glancing toward
the fiddley hatch, he noticed a wisp of steamy
vapor rising from it. In alarm he sprang forward to
look below. The heavy reek of hot engine oil met his
nostrils as he bent over the hatch. The hum and clink
of smoothly moving metal rose with it to reassure
him. Only the steamy mist between decks, and a slowing
of the engine’s rhythmic beat spelled danger to
the officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning to the engine room ladder, Lieutenant Allen
made the lower deck in record time. Through a mist
of steam, he made out the body of the Chief
Machinist’s Mate. Pausing beside it only long enough to read
the signs of death, he pressed on as far as he dared
toward the broken steam line.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up on the <em>Gatoon’s</em> bridge, Lieutenant Darnley
caught the engine room’s urgent signal. Picking up the
speaking tube, he barked a short acknowledgement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Allen speaking,” came the terse reply. “Inform Captain
Riggs of attempt to sabotage the ship’s engines.
Chief Machinist’s Mate Ahern is dead at his post. Must
stop engines and pull boiler fires at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The meal was just over in the officers’ mess. With a
low exclamation Don Winslow jumped up and stepped
to the nearest porthole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I’m not mistaken, Captain,” he said, turning to
face the others, “this ship is losing way. The engines,
... hear that, sir? The vibration has stopped completely!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Riggs sprang to his feet, scowling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, Commander!” he cried. “We’ll be losing
steerage way in a few moments. I’ll ring the bridge
and find out....”</p>

<p class='c009'>A heavy knocking on the cabin door interrupted.
Opening it, the captain faced a breathless yeoman,
whose message of disaster fairly tumbled from his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trouble with the main steam line, sir!” the enlisted
man reported. “And the Chief Machinist’s Mate has
met with an accident, too. Lieutenant Allen requests
your presence at once in the engine room!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c010'>VII<br /> <br />“<i>MAN OVERBOARD!</i>”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Shoulder to shoulder with Captain Riggs, Don Winslow
made for the engine room ladder. In their wake
hurried the medical officer and Lieutenant Red Pennington.
Mercedes, at Michael Splendor’s insistence,
stayed behind in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one of them believed that the “accidents” reported
by the yeoman were at all accidental. With
Scorpion spies aboard trouble could be expected from
any quarter. Unfortunately, there was no guessing in
advance where disaster would break out; or treachery,
for that matter. Even as the <em>Gatoon’s</em> afterguard was
bending over Ahern’s twisted corpse in the engine
room, a shadowy form slipped into the radio shack,
abaft the galley. In the faint glow of a shaded bulb, the
man’s face was a mere blur. Only his hands showed in
dark outline, as they fingered a pair of invisible dials.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abruptly the fellow sat down, his right hand now
concealed beneath the table. A faint, almost inaudible
clicking began spelling out in International Morse
Code: “SCP—SCP—Acknowledge—SPC—SPC....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost immediately came the reply—a hoarse,
murmuring voice from outer space: “<em>Go ahead SC-3
with your report.</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the faint ticking filled the tiny room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Orders carried out,” it spelled rapidly. “Engines disabled
for the next twenty-four hours. CS-3.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was silence for a full minute. Then the voice
in the radiophone breathed harshly: “The master is
pleased. Stand by at midnight for further instructions.
That is all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Below decks the <em>Gatoon’s</em> medical officer rose, white-faced,
from his examination of the Chief Machinist’s
Mate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This man is dead, though the body is still quite
warm!” he stated. “I should say he had been strangled
by a noose of thin wire, which became embedded in
the flesh. Somebody removed the thing before we got
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Allen, catching the captain’s glance of
query, shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t touch Ahern, except to turn him over, sir,”
he declared. “And there was no one else in the engine
room when I arrived. Strange way to kill a man, with
a wire noose!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The French call it '<em>La Garrote</em>,’” observed Don
Winslow, stooping to pick a peculiar metal object from
a dark corner of the deck. “If I’m not mistaken, this
thing is it! Looks as if the killer dropped it in his hurry
to get away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At his words the others turned to stare in fascinated
horror. The death instrument was a loop of extremely
thin but tough steel wire, threaded through a small
metal hand grip. A sharp pull on the latter tightened
and locked the strangling noose in the same motion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See!” remarked the young Intelligence Officer. “A
man could hide this weapon in his closed hand, or slip
it into a watch pocket. It’s deadlier than a knife in the
back. Look here, Captain! No need to let the crew
know just how Ahern was killed, is there? A thing
like this could demoralize a ship’s company in no
time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The grizzled ship’s master met Don’s look in
thoughtful silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand, Commander,” he said at last. “Knowing
what <em>we</em> do, every enlisted man aboard would be
suspecting his mates—afraid to turn his back for a second,
for fear of feeling his wind shut off! You’re right
about keeping it quiet. We’ll put poor Ahern in the
bos’n’s locker, and take the key away. Then the engine
crew can get busy at that broken steam line.... How
long before we can get under way again, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lieutenant Allen shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it were only the steam line, I’d say four or five
hours, sir,” he replied dubiously. “But I saw what
looked like emery dust near the main shaft bearings.
If any of that stuff’s been used we might not make port
for a week, if then. All depends on what we find in the
next hour, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And on how close a watch we keep after that, Captain!”
put in Don Winslow. “I’d suggest an armed
guard be stationed at every vital part of this ship.
Lieutenant Pennington and I will help you keep watch
topside, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tossing a wink over his shoulder to Red, he turned
to the ladder leading on deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometime after midnight the two young officers
stood shoulder to shoulder in the shadow of a port
lifeboat, the wind blowing their whispered words out
to sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got your automatic handy, Red?” Don asked
casually, resting an arm on the ship’s rail. “We’re part
of that guard I mentioned to Captain Riggs, you know.
The difference is that we’re not stationed anywhere in
particular.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cleaned and loaded my gun before mess gear blew
this evening,” young Pennington answered. “But, say!
Do you really think there’ll be another attempt to put
the <em>Gatoon</em> out of commission?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do,” Don replied, “though mere sabotage wouldn’t
be the Scorpion’s real object. He doesn’t go in for small-time
stuff. He’d like to sink us all without a trace, and
if I didn’t know that we’d destroyed his pirate submarine....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But maybe he’s got another we don’t know about!”
cut in Red excitedly. “With her engines crippled, this
old cutter’d be an easy mark for a torpedo. Or for any
armed yacht the Scorpion might have handy. Say, Don,
I’ll bet that’s the answer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep your shirt on, Red!” Don Winslow laughed
softly. “Your theory sounds okay, if you say it fast, but
don’t let it scare you off on a wrong tack. I’d stake my
commission, on there <em>not</em> being another enemy submarine
in these waters; and as for an armed yacht attacking
us—well, the <em>Gatoon’s</em> guns outrange any but a
destroyer’s. No! There’s some worse danger afloat, and
it’s up to us....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s words trailed off into silence. Stepping deeper
into the lifeboat’s shadow, his form was suddenly
blotted out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Red!” came his low call, above the slosh of waves
against the ship’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>At once, the stocky lieutenant moved in the direction
of Don’s voice. Feeling his way along the lifeboat’s
keel, he felt his arm grasped firmly. An instant later
an end of light cordage was pressed into his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the second I’ve located,” Don Winslow
whispered in his friend’s ear. “My hand happened to
find the first one by accident. What do you make of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—it’s a boat lashing, Don!” muttered Red,
wonderingly. “That means the tarpaulin’s loose, and a
stiff breeze would lift it.... Huh! You don’t suppose
that’s where the killer’s hiding himself—right in this
boat above our heads?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He may have hidden <em>anything</em>!” Don answered
briefly. “Here, let me stand on your shoulders and take
a look!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Red braced himself, Don went up, catlike, to grip
the lifeboat’s gunwhale. Fishing in a pocket, he produced
a small flashlight. It’s beam, thrust under the
canvas boat cover, lighted up the whole cavelike space
beneath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red, crouched in the darkness below, felt Don’s
weight suddenly leave his shoulders. Glancing up, he
saw his friend’s dim form disappearing inside the boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moments passed, with only a faint whisper of movement
from inside the covered lifeboat. Red Pennington
waited nervously at his post, alert for the slightest sound
of approaching footsteps. If the spy had hidden something
of value, the fellow might be coming back for
it at any time!</p>

<p class='c009'>Red’s reasoning was better than his hearing, as a
matter of fact. When he did hear the faint step behind
him, it was too late to turn. Jerking his head to one side,
the stocky lieutenant just saved himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>A numbing blow descended on his shoulder. With
a grunt, Red whirled, his fist coming up in a wicked
hook which contacted flesh and bone. The unseen assailant’s
gasp of pain came a second before Red’s
whoop: “I’ve got him, Don! Come—ugh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thug’s elbow jammed into Red’s midriff, and
loosened a perfectly good hammer lock. The lieutenant
gagged, lost his grip and his footing together, as
the enemy tripped him with a jiu-jitsu trick.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that second, Don Winslow’s lithe form dropped
from above.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only darkness and the snakelike agility of the Scorpion
spy prevented his capture then and there. The
man leaped over Red’s body, barely avoiding Don’s
rush, and jumped for the rail beyond the lifeboat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red, scrambling to his feet, lunged for the boat’s forward
end. Without warning there came a heavy splash
from overside. Don’s shout, “Man overboard!” followed
instantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G-great guns, Don!” Red gulped, bringing up
against the rail. “I thought he’d knocked <em>you</em> overside!
What happened, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He jumped!” clipped Don Winslow as other voices
on deck and bridge took up the cry of “<em>Man overboard!</em>”
“Listen, Red! You hustle aft and get a place
in the first boat that’s lowered. Don’t tell ’em the whole
story—only that someone attacked you and jumped
overboard when you fought back. Lively now, before
anybody sees us together!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Badly mystified, Red Pennington trotted aft to the
group gathering around Number Three lifeboat. He
had a hundred questions to ask, starting with: Why
was Don staying behind? On the other hand, orders
were orders, and questions would keep until Don chose
to answer them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c010'>VIII<br /> <br /><i>THE SECOND ATTACK</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sixty seconds from the moment Don shouted warning,
Number Three lifeboat was swinging, fully
manned, from her davits. On the dark water below,
two life preservers, with patent flares attached, floated
along the <em>Gatoon’s</em> portside. The ship, with engines
dead, rolled gently in the trough of a gentle ground
swell.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a rescue at night, no better conditions could be
asked. The trouble was that, from the moment Red
Pennington’s attacker had hit the water, there had been
no sign of him. No second splash or cry for help had
been heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was the fellow a suicide—deliberately drowning in
preference to being caught? Or had he just gone down,
unable to swim?</p>

<p class='c009'>One guess was as good as another. Except that the
man was a Scorpion agent, Don Winslow would have
given the fellow up for lost. As it was, he suspected a
trick.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thinking back, he recalled that the spy had not hit
the water all sprawled out like a man who had lost
his balance. There had been only the single, clean
<em>plunk</em> of an expert dive.</p>

<p class='c009'>But where, in mid-ocean, could the man have swum?
To a waiting boat, somewhere out of sight in the
darkness?</p>

<p class='c009'>There was one more alternative. As the idea flashed
across Don’s brain, he whirled and ran to the starboard
rail. After sweeping the ship’s side in one quick glance,
he turned again and darted back to the after deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Halted at the taffrail, the young officer leaned far
over, his eyes squinting to pierce the darkness under
the gunboat’s stern. After a moment, he straightened
up with a satisfied nod, and strode back to the portside.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little group of ship’s officers stood beside Mercedes
and Michael Splendor near the davits, just as Don
approached. All of them caught the young commander’s
quiet words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send your boat around under the stern, Captain
Riggs,” Don Winslow murmured. “Our man is there,
clinging to the rudder post. If we go softly, we can
all get back to the taffrail in time to see the fun!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant Riggs stared in unbelief, then turned
to snap an order at the men below. As the oars resumed
their steady stroke alongside, Don led his friends aft
on tiptoe. He knew the questions they wanted to ask;
but there was no time now for talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few feet from the taffrail, Don signaled the two
ship’s officers to stand by. He himself stooped with one
hand on the line of the taffrail log.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wait was not long. As the lifeboat started to
round the stern, the stout line under Don’s fingers
jerked taut. By its motion he knew that his man was
climbing, hand over hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only a trained athlete could have performed such a
feat, for the line was barely thick enough to hold a
man’s weight. The climber’s hands must have been cut
raw after the first half dozen grips, but he came doggedly
on. At the last moment before his head appeared,
Don drew back in a wrestler’s crouch.</p>

<p class='c009'>A lunge, a harsh oath, a brief, desperate struggle,
and it was over. The unknown, who had attacked Red
Pennington and then plunged into the sea, now stood
on deck, panting in the grip of three strong men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So what?” he demanded insolently. “Now ya got
me, wot ya gonna do with me? I ain’t done nothin’
wrong. A guy up an’ slugs me in the dark, an’ I fall
overboard, an’ now ya grab me. So what!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s flashlight, turned on the man’s face showed
a pair of small, ratty eyes set in animallike features.
The fellow was desperate, and trying to cover it up with
a line of bluff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks as if we’d caught our murderer, all right!”
gritted Captain Riggs, after a shrewd glance. “This
seaman is one of the replacements we took on in Guantanamo.
Shall I throw him in the brig now, Commander,
or do you wish to question him first?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow snapped out his light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The questioning had better wait, Captain,” he replied
quickly. “I’ve just discovered something that may
be of vital importance to us and every honest sailor
aboard. Suppose we all talk it over in your cabin, as
soon as this spy is safely under lock and key!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On his way to the captain’s quarters, Don Winslow
stopped by Number Three davits and waited until the
lifeboat had been swung inboard with its crew. As Red
Pennington stepped to the deck, the young commander
seized his arm and led him back into the shadows amidships.
A few quick words covered the rat-faced seaman’s
capture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now we’ll see what his game was, Red,” Don
whispered, moving over to the port rail. “Give me a
boost up into that boat with the unlashed cover and
stand by for trouble. But don’t let anybody slug you
from behind this time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t, don’t kid yourself!” muttered the stocky
lieutenant, stooping to take Don’s weight. “But, say!
You must have found something up there the first time,
or you wouldn’t be so anxious to look again. Can’t you
wait long enough to tell a man...?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Don was already over the gunwhale and inside
the boat. This time several minutes passed before his
head and shoulders appeared from under the tarpaulin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take these, Red!” he said softly, passing down a
loose packet of papers. “And put them out of sight. I’m
coming down now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Swinging light to the deck, he drew his pocket gun
and led the way back aft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wha-what the dickens?” muttered Red Pennington
in a hoarse whisper, as he shoved the papers under
his waistband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Enlistment records—the missing ones!” hissed Don,
glancing along the shadowy decks. “They were just
part of what I found in the boat. If anybody tries to
take them away from you between here and the captain’s
quarters....”</p>

<p class='c009'>WHAM! BANG!</p>

<p class='c009'>A tongue of flame had lanced out from behind the
darkened galley. In the same split second had come
Don’s answering shot. Without pausing the young commander
leaped straight toward the source of attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red, pounding at Don’s heels, tugged out his pistol.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take the starboard side!” he yelped as Don
darted to port.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed that the enemy, whoever he was, must be
trapped, or he would have to break away in full view
and get shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet it was Red Pennington whom Don bumped into,
just abaft the galley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G-gosh! I nearly shot you, Don!” gulped the stout
lieutenant. “Where’n thunder did that bird go, anyway?
I was sure you were he, till I got a second look!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer Don seized the knob of the galley door.
It flew open to reveal a dimly lighted interior, fragrant
with the smell of brewing coffee. Backed up in a corner
stood Johnson, the colored cook, brandishing a razor-sharp
meat axe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay right wheah yo’ are, befo’ ah scattahs you’
brains!” wailed the terrified man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don stepped calmly across the threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all right, Johnson,” he said, sweeping the galley
with a quick look. “Somebody shot at us just now, and
we thought he might have ducked in here. Of course,
you didn’t see anybody?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Johnson’s meat cleaver hit the deck with a loud
clang.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lawsy-me, C’mandah!” he quavered. “Ah sho’
thought you-all was de killah. Yassah! But ah raickon
he was de one dat scooted by de po’thole, right aftah
de shot! Ah jes’ happened ter look out....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which way did he go?” Don snapped, turning back
to the doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was haided aft, C’mandah,” answered the colored
man. “Ah jes’ seen somethin’ white scootin’ past!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Red!” said Don, stepping out on deck.
“We’ll try the radio shack. It’s part of this same superstructure,
and our last bet. Hope you kept an eye on it,
while I was in the galley!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did,” answered Red. “The only door is on this
side, too. Got your flashlight ready? The place looks
pitch dark!”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time, shouts and the sound of running feet
were closing in from all sides. The twin pistol shots had
roused the whole ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now, quite unintentionally, Red Pennington
made a grandstand play.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thinking only to save Don from the killer’s bullets,
he slammed open the radio shack door and charged
through, head down, like a football tackle. There followed
a yell and the thud of heavy bodies striking the
deck. An instant later half a dozen men headed by
Don Winslow piled into the narrow compartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>No shots greeted their rush, though for a moment
there was plenty of confusion. With some difficulty,
Red Pennington was pulled off from the kicking body
of his victim, who turned out to be the <em>Gatoon’s</em> radio
operator. The man was breathless, battered, and evidently
furious beneath his show of respect for gold
braid.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave his name as A. Corba, Electrician First Class,
and he told a reasonably straight story. He had been
sitting half asleep in his chair, he said, listening in to
the radio conversations between other ships in the
Caribbean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly he’d heard two pistol shots, and the sound
of men running. He was still wondering what it was
all about, when the door burst open and two hundred
pounds of fighting man landed on him. Naturally he’d
tried to fight back, but his attacker, who turned out to
be Lieutenant Pennington, had him licked from the
start.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow heard the story through, without a
change of expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” he asked, “did you have the deadlights
screwed over the portholes. Is that customary aboard
this craft?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain Riggs’ orders, sir,” replied the radio operator
instantly. “That is, we were all warned to let no
lights show our position to any passing boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s right, Commander!” spoke up the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
captain, from the doorway. “I did give that order; and
it strikes me that this man’s account holds water. Whoever
shot at you must have gotten away, at least for the
time being. What puzzles me is the reason for such
an attack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose we talk that over in your quarters, sir,”
Don suggested, moving toward the door. “If I’m not
mistaken, we’re due for more surprises before the night
is over!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c010'>IX<br /> <br /><i>RED NABS A SPY</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Don Winslow’s brief account of the two attacks on
Red and himself did little to clear up the mystery
which hung like a dark cloud over the <em>Gatoon’s</em> after
guard. Both assaults appeared to have the same object,
however—to get back the stolen enlistment records
which Don had found hidden in the lifeboat. For some
reason the enemy was afraid to have those records
examined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s how I’ve figured it out,” Don told the little
company gathered in the captain’s cabin, “either the
records of Scorpion agents among the crew are missing,
or they’ve been forged. In any case, a careful check
should tell the story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Spreading out the rumpled enlistment papers on the
captain’s table, he commenced a swift search, while
Riggs and Red Pennington looked over his shoulders.
All at once he picked up one of the documents and
smoothed it out. The name on the outside read: “Anton
Corba,” with the rating noted as “Radioman, First
Class.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why pick that one, Commander?” asked Captain
Riggs sharply. “What reason have you to suspect....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, Captain!” Don Winslow interrupted. “The
signatures on this record show signs of tracing. Forgery,
all right, but a mighty clumsy job. Just study it
for a minute and give me your opinion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Handing the paper to Riggs, he whispered rapidly
in the officer’s ear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a hunch we are being overheard now.
Corba or some other spy may be the eavesdropper. I’m
sending Pennington out to check up. Meantime we
must all keep talking naturally, so the fellow will not
suspect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a nod of understanding, Riggs moved over to
Michael Splendor’s chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see what you mean, Commander,” he said loudly.
“At least one of these signatures looks smeary, but I’m
no handwriting expert. Tell me what you think of it,
Mr. Splendor. As chief of the Haitian Naval
Intelligence, you should know about such things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stooping quickly, he whispered Don Winslow’s plan
to the cripple. At the same instant Don was muttering
advice in Red’s ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take off your shoes,” he told the wide-eyed lieutenant.
“Sneak up topside and try to locate anyone who
may be eavesdropping. If you don’t spot anyone, come
back in five minutes. Here’s my flashlight. Shove off
now, and good luck! We’ll carry on the show down
here till you report or signal us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Red silently closed the cabin door behind him,
he heard Michael Splendor’s voice within, taking up
the mock discussion. The “show” as Don called it,
would be quite convincing to any eavesdropper.</p>

<p class='c009'>And if Don was right in his guess, the spy should
be easy to surprise at his work. At that hour of night,
no enlisted man would have any legitimate business
hanging around the cabin ventilators.</p>

<p class='c009'>Silent as a shadow, for all his bulk, Red Pennington
emerged onto the starlit deck. Slipping aft, he rounded
the cabin skylight and probed the shadows under the
port rail.</p>

<p class='c009'>No glimpse of a furtive lurker rewarded him, however.
With a grunt of disappointment, he padded
forward, heading for the midship’s superstructure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll just take a look inside the radio shack,” he muttered
under his breath. “Don seems to think that guy
Corba’s enlistment was forged—which means he
may be the guy who shot at us, too. He’s got a fishy
mug, anyway, and his story was a little too slick when
we jumped him a few minutes ago!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door of the radio shack was on the port side.
Therefore, as an extra precaution, Red circled the superstructure
to starboard, halting at the corner of the
galley.</p>

<p class='c009'>The space between the deck house and the rail was
empty, yet something about it looked queer. For a moment
Red stood blinking in puzzlement, trying to make
out what was wrong. All at once it came to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The radio shack door was open at least two inches;
yet no light shone through onto the white deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since Navy men do not go about leaving doors ajar,
this suggested one of two things: either Corba had left
in a desperate hurry, or he was still inside, <em>with the
lights out</em>! Red Pennington intended to find out which.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the utmost caution, he crept past the galley,
noting that the door beyond him did not sway with
the gentle roll of the ship. That meant it was propped
open deliberately. But <em>why</em>?</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as his hand was reaching for the knob, the door
swung shut. Red froze in his tracks, his mind racing.
Whoever had closed that two-inch opening could not
have seen him. The door itself had hid his approach.
The thing proved simply that the radio shack was occupied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Red could plan his next move, a faint, metallic
ticking caught his ear. Pressing his ear close to the
shack’s steel wall, he made out the familiar chatter of a
wireless key, sending in International Morse Code.</p>

<p class='c009'>“—REPORTING—EMERGENCY—ABOARD—GATOON”
Red silently spelled out the message.
“AGENT SC-21 SEIZED. WINSLOW AND PENNINGTON
HAVE DISCOVERED FORGED
ENLISTMENT PAPERS IN LIFEBOAT WE
PREPARED FOR OUR GETAWAY. THIS WILL
LEAD ANY MOMENT TO MY ARREST AND
THAT OF AGENT SC-17. PLEASE ADVISE
NEXT MOVE. SC-3.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While listening, Red Pennington had slipped Don’s
flashlight from his pocket. As the message ended, he
wrenched open the door and shot the bright beam into
the radio shack. It’s spotlight steadied on the tense
figure of Corba, seated beside the room’s small tool
bench.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just hold that pose, sailor!” gritted the stocky lieutenant.
“No—keep your left hand under the bench!
Don’t move a muscle——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whipping out his pocket gun, Red slammed two
shots at the steel decking, close to Corba’s feet. Instantly
the white-faced radioman froze in his chair, his
pose still as a statue’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s better!” clipped the lieutenant, as shouts and
the stamp of feet sounded from the cabin country.
“In just a moment you’re going to tell your story over
again; and it had better be the right one this time. Do
you get me, <em>Agent SC-3</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Warned by Red’s sharp call, Don Winslow halted
the captain and Lieutenant Darnley outside the radio
shack. Stepping inside alone, he snapped on the lights.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great work, Red!” he approved, when the red-haired
lieutenant briefly outlined what had happened.
“We’ve caught our eavesdropper this time, and....”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off as a harsh whisper rose, seemingly from
beneath the workbench.</p>

<p class='c009'>“AGENT SC-3 AND SC-17, ATTENTION!” the
weird voice rasped. “YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO
LEAVE THE SHIP AT ONCE, USING LIFEBELTS.
SEAPLANE WILL PICK YOU UP AT
DAWN. SC-21 WILL PAY PENALTY FOR HIS
FAILURE WHEN WE BOMB GATOON FROM
THE AIR. THAT IS ALL!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A gasp from the unhappy Corba gave Don Winslow
the cue for his next play. Ignoring the startled questions
of Captain Riggs and Lieutenant Allen, he faced
the radio operator.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Corba!” he said tightly. “That message
shows you just where you get off. Like SC-21, you’re going
to pay the penalty for failure, when and if bombs
start dropping on this vessel! Is your loyalty to Scorpia
strong enough to stand up under that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hollow-eyed with fear, the Scorpion spy shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve named it, Commander!” he said hoarsely.
“The Scorpion don’t have much mercy for them that
are fools enough to get caught. But what good’ll it do,
sir, if I tell you what I know? We’re all bound for
Davy Jones’ locker, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s laugh rang as hard as the slap of
bullets on steel armor plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We <em>were</em>, maybe, but we’re taking a new tack,
sailor!” he barked. “Now we know what your murderous
pals are up to, we can outthink and outfight them
too. The only man aboard who’s bound for Davy Jones
is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain!” cried a breathless voice on deck. “The
prisoner, Durkin—the man you put in the brig, sir—he’s
dead! Hanged himself, with a loop of wire he’d
made fast to a steampipe. We found this note, written
on an old envelope. Here it is, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a startled pause, Captain Riggs stepped inside
to hold a crumpled envelope under the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you make of this, Commander?” he
growled. “Things are happening a bit too fast for me
to keep my bearings tonight, this note, for instance! It
says: 'I queered your engines and killed the Chief Machinist’s
Mate. When the Scorpion strikes, you’ll think
I did Ahern a favor. <em>Signed</em>, Durkin.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so exit Scorpion Agent SC-21!” observed Don
Winslow harshly. “He killed himself rather than go
down later with the ship. That leaves one enemy agent
still unidentified. Who is he, Corba?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seaman Second Class, by the name of Mink,” replied
the radioman sullenly. “He’s just a tough gorilla
we brought aboard for strong arm work. As it turned
out, we didn’t have to use him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which means <em>you</em> were the bird who shot at us tonight
from the corner of the galley!” put in Red Pennington.
“You sure hated to let us get a look at those
forged enlistment records, didn’t you, Mr. A. Corba?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a snort of anger, Captain Riggs turned to the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The whole business smells like plain mutiny to me!”
he declared. “While you’re questioning this man, Commander,
I’m going to hunt up Seaman Second Class
Mink, and throw him in irons! Join me in my quarters,
gentlemen, when you’re ready to compare notes.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c010'>X<br /> <br /><i>A DESPERATE SCHEME</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The questioning of Anton Corba, Electrician First
Class, took less than twenty minutes; but it laid bare
the whole Scorpion plot to destroy the gunboat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Corba and the other two spies had come aboard at
Guantanamo. The Navy men whose places they took,
had been kidnapped by other Scorpion agents, and held
until the gunboat sailed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The rest was easy, sir,” the prisoner stated, with a
nervous glance at Red Pennington’s gun. “I rigged up
a special sending key and an extra short-wave receiver
with the help of stuff I’d smuggled aboard. I kept in
touch with the Scorpia headquarters by tunin’ into a
new wave length they gave me each day. And I listened
in to any talk aboard ship with this electric 'ear’ which
they say the Scorpion himself invented. Here it is, if
you want to look at it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slipping a hand inside his blouse, Corba produced
the tiny amplifier and earphone. Don Winslow took it
from him, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clever!” he nodded, noting the hairlike wires
and fine workmanship. “I suspected something like
this, Red, when I sent you up on deck to look around.
With his door ajar, Sparks here could get every
whisper coming up the cabin ventilators.... Well, Corba,
if that’s your name, I guess that explains how you knew
we were going to search the enlistment records. The
minute I was alone in the Captain’s quarters, you just
slipped in and bopped me on the head, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir!” gulped the radio operator, squirming unhappily
on his chair. “You see, I had to, sir. I mean, I
was afraid you’d....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stow it!” rapped Don, his tone suddenly hard. “Get
down to brass tacks, and give us the rest of this program
for sinking a Navy vessel on the high seas. Putting
the engines out of commission was only a starter,
of course. Let’s hear what comes next.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Corba’s black eyes slid away from the impact of Don’s
steely gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—why, there ain’t no 'next,’ sir,” he answered,
nervously. “Not until daylight, when a couple of fast
bombin’ planes dive outa the sky and drop about a
ton of high explosive down your fiddley hatch. What
happens then don’t need no imagination to figure out,
sir! And no man aboard can do a thing to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horse feathers!” burst out Red Pennington. “We’ve
got anti-aircraft guns, mounted fore and aft, that can
blow half a dozen fast bombers clean out of the ozone.
What’re you trying to do, punk? Throw a scare into
us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Drawn-faced, the radio operator shook his head. For
a second, he seemed about to reply, but instead merely
licked his lips and looked away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow sensed that the man was half-crazy
with terror, every time he thought or spoke of the coming
air attack. And for that fear there could be only
one good reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might as well tell it straight, Corba!” he told
the fidgeting prisoner. “Go on and admit that the ship’s
guns have been damaged, as well as the engines! Unable
to fight or run, this ship will be just a helpless
target—or so you believe. Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The radioman’s jaw dropped. He nodded weakly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see how you guessed it, sir,” he whimpered;
“Mink fixed every gun two nights ago. He used an
explosive metal plug that’ll make the gun blow up the
first time it’s fired. I’d have told you before, only there
ain’t a thing you can do to fix ’em, sir. We’re gonna
be sunk, with all hands, and that’s all there is to it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great jumpin’ catfish!” gurgled Red Pennington.
“I never thought once about the guns being jimmied
too! What can we do now, Don?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First put this man in the brig with his gorilla shipmate!”
clipped out the young commander. “After that,
we’re going to move a lot farther and faster than the
Scorpion expects. You stay by the radio until I send
up a regular guard, Red. And, Corba! March yourself
straight through that door and forward to the brig.
Lively now! My gun will be right at your back the
whole way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Back in the radio shack, after seeing the lock turned
on both Scorpion spies, Don Winslow sat down to compose
a code radiogram to Navy Intelligence Headquarters
at Washington. A trusted boatswain’s mate
armed with rifle and bayonet stood outside to guard
against interruptions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The message, as Red Pennington translated it aloud,
read: “GATOON SABOTAGED. STOP. NOW
DRIFTING OFF THE COAST OF HAITI WITH
GUNS AND ENGINES DISABLED. STOP. EXPECT
ATTACK BY ENEMY BOMBERS AT DAYLIGHT.
STOP. SEND FAST ATTACK PLANES
TO OUR ASSISTANCE AT ONCE. STOP. OUR
POSITION IS....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s what I make it, Winslow!” interrupted Captain
Riggs entering the room with sextant in one hand
and a sheet of penciled figures in the other. “Good
thing it’s a clear night, for 'shooting’ the stars. By my
reckoning, we’re just ten miles off the coast, and ninety
more from Port-au-Prince.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Captain!” said Don, glancing at the
other’s notes. “Shall I sign your name now to this radio
message? If we send it at once, those Navy planes will
have barely time to get here before the fun starts!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sign it yourself, Commander,” replied Riggs
quickly. “Your name will carry twice the weight of
mine with Washington. But, blow me under if I like
this idea of lying here useless till help comes! Isn’t
there any trick we can work out to defend ourselves
with?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think there is, Captain,” answered Don Winslow,
rising from his chair. “I’d like to talk it over first,
though, with Michael Splendor. Suppose we join him,
below, while Pennington is sending this radio I’ve just
coded. Red’s an expert operator, so there won’t be any
mistakes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Below, in the captain’s quarters. Lieutenant Darnley
had just finished outlining the situation to Splendor
and Mercedes Colby. The girl was taking the latest
news of sabotage and sudden death with cool courage,
as became the daughter of a Navy Admiral. Even the
likelihood of being bombed and sunk by a Scorpion
airship failed to terrify her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that I know the worst, I’m not scared at all,”
she smiled pluckily. “It was <em>not</em> knowing what fiendish
thing the Scorpion was planning, that was the hardest
to bear. There are lots of worse deaths than drowning.
And anyhow, I can’t believe it will come to that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither can I!” put in Michael Splendor, quietly.
“With Don Winslow on deck, our chances of making
port are better than the enemy’s. He’ll find a way to
fight back, never fear! Besides, there’s me own seaplane
we took aboard last night. She has two machine
guns and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without knocking, Captain Riggs flung open the
door and entered, with Don Winslow at his heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a few plans to talk over with you, sir!” the
latter announced, halting before the cripple’s wheel
chair. “Lieutenant Darnley has told you the latest trouble,
I suppose—about our anti-aircraft guns being
jimmied?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has that!” replied Splendor. “And I knew you’d
have a plan to overcome that difficulty, Commander.
'Tis honored I am that ye wish to discuss it with a
useless old man like me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve been called 'the brains of the Haitian Intelligence
Service,’” Don retorted. “And if brains are
useless, it’s news to me! Joking aside, sir, there are three
good reasons against our being bombed and sunk at
daylight. I’ll name them over, and see if you agree
with me. Perhaps Captain Riggs and Lieutenant Darnley
may have some valuable suggestions to make, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go ahead. Commander!” nodded the crippled man,
as the others grouped themselves closer about Don. “I
had a couple of schemes in me own mind, but three
sounds better yet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In short, rapid sentences, Don Winslow outlined the
hopes of the <em>Gatoon’s</em> company.</p>

<p class='c009'>First was the message now being radioed by Red
Pennington to Captain Holding of the Naval Intelligence
in Washington. A squadron of light bombing
planes would be taking off within an hour to come
to the <em>Gatoon’s</em> rescue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether or not they would arrive in time was another
question, of course. The distance of the nearest
fighting ships, the weather they might meet on the
way, and various other difficulties made the answer
uncertain. Less than three hours now remained before
daybreak and the Scorpion’s attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pursuit type planes, Don explained, could have made
the distance quicker, but could not carry enough gas
for a round trip.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s second plan was for Panama and an expert
machine gunner to take Splendor’s armed seaplane up
at crack of dawn to watch for enemy aircraft, and fight
them off. Even if hopelessly outnumbered, the pilot
and his gunner could delay an attack upon the <em>Gatoon</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that,” boomed Michael Splendor, his eyes
gleaming eagerly, “is the very job I picked for meself!
I’ll need no legs to use a machine gun, ye see. I’ve already
talked it over with my pilot. The lad is anxious
to try his luck in a real air fight, whatever the odds.
And now, Commander, let’s have your third scheme.
I’ve no doubt it includes yourself, and that redheaded
lieutenant. If so, it will be the most dangerous job of
all, and the most difficult, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not so sure of that, sir,” Don protested. “In fact
it’s as simple as jumping overboard with a life preserver on.
That’s what the Scorpion’s gang expect their
two spies to do; so what’s to keep Red and me from
taking their places?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then what, Don?” asked Mercedes Colby in a
strained tone. “I suppose you think a Scorpion pilot
will pick you up without asking questions or bothering
to recognize you? More likely he’ll turn his machine
gun on you and leave you for the fishes. Oh, Don, don’t
try anything so desperately foolish!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c010'>XI<br /> <br /><i>JAWS OF DEATH</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was Michael Splendor whose reasoning finally
calmed the girl’s worst fears for Don and Red. It was
a known rule of “Scorpia,” he pointed out, that only
agents who had to work in close contact should know
each other, even by sight. Therefore, dressed in seamen’s
uniforms, the two young officers would run little
risk of discovery until they actually boarded the pickup
plane.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, things would begin to happen fast, with
probably fatal results to someone!</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, Mercedes,” Don added, “we’ve simply got
to capture that enemy ship! It’s bound to be armed with
one or more machine guns. In any case, it would double
our chances of beating off enemy bombers until
our own squadron shows up. And, by the way—we’ve
got just two hours now to sunrise. We’d better get
started without any more delay!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Returning on deck, the officers found Red Pennington
just signing off a code conversation with Captain
Holding in Washington. The Intelligence Officer had
been routed out of bed and was personally directing
the despatch of fighting planes to the <em>Gatoon’s</em> rescue.
It seemed doubtful, however, that the squadron could
arrive in less than three hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can only hope,” Captain Riggs remarked, anxiously,
“that something will delay the enemy’s arrival,
too. The best I can do aboard is to muster the crew on
deck with loaded rifles. If the bombers try diving at us,
our bullets <em>might</em> take effect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a brief discussion, it was decided to take Don
and Red in one of the lifeboats, about half a mile to leeward
of the <em>Gatoon</em>, and there drop them overside. The
water was fairly warm off the coast of Haiti. The only
real danger they would face, while drifting about on
the black, mile-deep water, would be from sharks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question of uniforms was quickly settled, by new
outfits drawn from the ship’s “slop-chest.” Don was to
impersonate Corba, with the red and white rating
badge on his blouse sleeve placing him as a Radioman,
First Class. Red, being husky and heavily built, would
take the part of the “gorilla” seaman, Mink.</p>

<p class='c009'>The change of clothing was quickly made; but first,
both young officers strapped on pistol holsters under
their blouses. The weapons themselves, fully loaded,
were sealed in watertight oiled silk. Life belts, clumsy
but buoyant, made their outfit complete.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just before they took their places in the ready lifeboat,
Lieutenant Allen came hurrying from the engine
room to report a piece of good luck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve repaired the steam line, sir,” he said, approaching
Captain Riggs, “and we had an easier job of
cleaning out that emery dust from the machinery than
I had expected. We’ll be ready to get under way in half
an hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Splendid! Great work, Lieutenant!” cried the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
skipper. “That gives us an extra chance in case
we are bombed. A ship steaming in zigzag is a harder
target to hit. We’ll just drift until daylight; but see that
you have full steam up by then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Before then</em>, if you don’t mind, Captain!” put in
Michael Splendor, rolling his wheel chair up to the rail.
“The steam winch will be needed to lower yon seaplane overside.
'Tis a heavy weight to handle by manpower
alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Riggs muttered a brief consent, and turned
to grip the hands of the two departing officers. Quickly,
Mercedes, Splendor, and the <em>Gatoon’s</em> afterguard followed
suit. There were no formal good-bys; but the
words spoken were packed with meaning:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good luck, Don! So long, Red!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See you later, Commander!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Expertly manned, the lifeboats touched the water
with scarcely a sound. The boat falls were quickly released;
strong arms pushed the little craft clear of the
<em>Gatoon’s</em> looming side. Above, the dim blur of faces at
the ship’s rail faded from sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out ... oars!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The coxswain’s low spoken order came from the lifeboat’s
stern sheets. It was answered by the soft thudding
of oars into rowlocks. Don and Red, in their
seamen’s uniforms, each gripped one of the long ash
blades, “feathered” it by a drop of their wrists, and held
it poised above the black water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Altogether.... Give way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the coxswain’s word, six tough muscled bodies
tensed; six oar blades hit the water at the same precise
instant. The little craft leaped forward like a startled
fish.</p>

<p class='c009'>Steering only by the light wind astern, it covered the
half mile to leeward of the <em>Gatoon</em> in about five minutes.
As there was no moon the ship could not be seen.
Only the starshine, reflected from the ocean’s heaving
surface, showed where water ended and air began.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a landsman, it would have given a queer sensation;
adrift in a small boat at night, with nothing to
see but starshine above or below; to know that a mile
beneath that black water lay the hills and valleys of the
ocean’s bottom; to think that, in just a minute, one
would be <em>in</em> that water up to one’s neck, with the lifeboat
pulling away, out of sight and sound!</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the seasoned sailors in the boat with Don and
Red must have had some such thoughts, though Navy
discipline kept them from saying anything. When the
two young officers stood up in their life belts, ready to
bail out, the coxswain alone spoke up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there anything else, Commander?” he asked
huskily. “Sure you don’t want us to stand by for a
while after you and the lieutenant go overboard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not, Coxswain!” replied Don with a quiet
laugh. “This isn’t a sea burial. It’s just a job Lieutenant
Pennington and I have to do. You’ll probably be in
more danger aboard the <em>Gatoon</em> than we will be here.
Steady, now! We’re going over the bow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye-aye, sir!” answered the petty officer, with a
catch in his voice. “And here’s wishin’ you and the
Lieutenant good luck!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lifeboat pitched and swung off as two heavy
splashes sounded over her bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good luck to you, Coxs’n!” sputtered Red Pennington
from the water. “Sheer off now and head for
the ship! They’re showing a signal light to give you
your bearings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the last faint splash of oars faded out, Don
Winslow spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Feel lonesome, Red?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A gasping breath from the darkness gave evidence of
Red’s position, even before he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“G-gee, Don!” he stuttered. “I wondered for a minute
if you’d drifted out of hearing. Sound off again,
Skipper, so I can paddle closer! I’d certainly hate to
float around here in the darkness and know I was all
alone.... Say, where are you, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here!” answered Don, shortly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh? Where? I thought you were over <em>there</em>!”
burbled Red Pennington between frantic splashings.
“Are you swimmin’ circles around me, Skipper, or is it
the darkness? Dawggone....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s your life preserver, Red!” Don chuckled. “Don’t
try to swim fast in that thing, or you’ll just spin round
and round. Paddle over here slowly, and I’ll pass you
an end of marline I brought along to lash us together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was some more splashing, and a final grunt of
relief as Red found Don’s hand holding the length of
tarred cord. For a while neither of them spoke. The
feeling of being suspended in wet, black space rather
dampened the wish to talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour passed in gloomy, uncomfortable silence,
before the first hint of daylight showed across the
tossing wave tops. Little by little the night sky paled,
making the water look all the blacker by contrast.
Then, a mile to windward, the two officers made out
the ship they had left—a faint, gray shadow breaking
a wave-notched horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve drifted quite a distance, shipmate,” Don observed,
gazing toward the <em>Gatoon</em>. “Too far for anybody
on board to sight us! I suppose they’re wondering
whether or not the sharks have gotten us by now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What <em>I’m</em> wondering is whether that Scorpion seaplane
is going to spot us or not,” responded Red Pennington.
“And something else just occurred to me—Will
the pilot have orders to pick us up before or <em>after</em>
they try the bomb the <em>Gatoon</em>? We didn’t think to ask
Corba that one, did we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He might not have known, anyhow,” Don
shrugged. “Quit thinking up so many different kinds
of hard luck, Red, and tell me how your appetite is.
I’ve got some chocolate and a couple of sea biscuits
stowed away in a waterproof envelope. There’s no telling
whether we’ll eat breakfast today....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or be eaten <em>for</em> breakfast!” Red cut in with a yell.
“Look! Isn’t that a shark?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c010'>XII<br /> <br /><i>TIGERS OF THE SEA</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One glance at the black, triangular fin slicing through
the water was enough. It was a shark of the man-eating
variety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get out your gun, Red!” barked Don Winslow,
reaching for his own weapon. “Hold it ready, but don’t
use it until the last possible moment. The smell of blood—even
shark’s blood—will drive the other sharks
mad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Biting his lips, the stocky lieutenant ripped the waterproof
silk from his Navy Colt’s revolver. Though he
could have led a landing party in the face of machine
gun fire, without a qualm of fear, the idea of becoming
shark meat while still alive was hard for Red Pennington
to get used to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s hopin’ there aren’t any other sharks around!”
he gulped. “If I don’t see any in the next two minutes,
I’m gonna shoot this one so full of holes....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold it!” Don Winslow rapped out. “I see another
fin—no, it’s three more! And more coming, off there
to port. Great guns, Red! We’re right in the middle of
a school of them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Calmly, he took a squint at the chambers of his revolver
making sure they were all loaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see now, Red, why I wouldn’t take automatic
pistols,” he said. “Those things jam up after a little
exposure to salt water. These revolvers can take it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yeah!” responded Red bitterly. “But what good’s all
that goin’ to do us if they come too fast for us to shoot?
HEY! LOOK OUT! HE’S COMING FOR YOU,
DON!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Twenty feet to starboard, a huge fin was driving
straight toward them. In another second the killer
shark would roll over for the bite, Don knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of firing, however, he brought both arms
down flat on the water, with a tremendous splash. At
the same time, he yelled like a trapped hyena.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a quick swirl, the shark changed his course;
but even so, it was a close call. So close that the killer’s
mighty tail slapped against Don’s legs with numbing
force.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wha-what’s the big idea?” gurgled Red, twisting
his neck to watch the shark’s departure. “You had time
to shoot him, Skipper!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not time to stop him!” replied Don. “Anyhow,
we don’t want any blood in the water as near to us as
that. I guess our best bet is to serve these sharks a breakfast,
but keep them as far away as possible. Like this!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Snapping up his Colt, Don Winslow fired at a circling
fin, about forty yards distant. There followed
the brief flurry of a wounded shark. Then, without
warning, the ocean round about was lashed to a froth.
Great bodies whirled and plunged in a circle of bloodstained
water. From all sides, the sharp, triangular fins
of the other sharks came streaking toward the center
of disturbance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And <em>that</em>,” gritted Don Winslow, “is the way they’d
be bearing down on us, if I’d shot that first would-be
man-eater, instead of scaring him! How’d you like to
be in the middle of that ring-around-the-rosie, Red?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“G-golly, no!” shivered the junior officer. “I’ve heard
that sharks were cannibals; but I never thought they
were such fast feeders. Look, Don! They’ve finished
that one already. Eaten him alive!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In which case we’d better give them some more
breakfast bacon,” agreed the young commander. “Go
ahead and shoot, sailor! It’s your turn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uh-uh, Don! It’s your turn all the time,” the redhead
responded. “As a marksman, I’ll never be in your
class, and we’ve got to save our bullets. That way, we
might keep those sea tigers busy eating themselves until
the plane shows up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Carefully Don picked his next target and fired. This
time his bullet merely clipped through the shark’s back
fin, but the wound was enough for its blood maddened
fellows. A second savage feast churned the water’s surface,
fifty yards away.</p>

<p class='c009'>One by one Don’s precious cartridges were expended,
until only half a dozen were left. The dawn light had
grown stronger now, and Red, glancing toward the
distant <em>Gatoon</em>, detected movement aboard her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve spotted us aboard ship!” he cried. “They’re
lowering a boat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s revolver cracked again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll get here just about in time,” he commented.
“That is, provided I don’t miss any shots. Every shark
in ten square miles must have smelled this party and
joined it. A number of them have been looking us over,
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve noticed that, Skipper, don’t worry!” Red Pennington
exclaimed. “It’s too bad the Scorpion plane
didn’t get here sooner, but.... Say! Am I hearing
things, or is that a plane’s motor, over to the east?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Above the splashing rose the snarl of an airplane
motor warming up. The sound rose in pitch, then faded
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s Splendor and his pilot taking off!” remarked
Don, his eye on the circling man-eaters. “They’ll climb
to ten thousand to start their watch for the bombers.
Right now, I envy them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long, listening moment, there was no sound
but the lapping of waves and the occasional splash of a
feeding shark. Very gradually the drone of an approaching
plane grew louder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not Splendor’s motor,” Don decided at last. “Besides,
it’s flying too low and straight to be on patrol.
It’s the Scorpion seaplane, all right, and headed straight
for us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be here before the boat from the <em>Gatoon</em>!” cried
Red Pennington. “Probably the pilot thinks the boat is
after a couple of spies. If he does, he’ll beat ’em to it
and pick us up! Where is he, though, Don? That
motor’s getting close, but there’s no plane in sight!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s because he’s flying low, right in the 'eye of
the sun,’ as they say,” replied the other, whipping up
his gun for another shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bullet missed, just as the target dived under.
Another slug from Don’s nearly exhausted supply furnished
more living “breakfast” for the ravenous sea
tigers. Two sharks swirled dangerously close to the two
officers in the turmoil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better start splashing and keep it up, Red!” Don
Winslow advised. “Those finny devils are getting more
curious about us every second. If we can keep them off
just a few more minutes....”</p>

<p class='c009'>CR-RASH! SLAP! SWISH!</p>

<p class='c009'>The school of sharks scattered in all directions, as a
seaplane’s pontoons smashed down into the water close
by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahoy, you two!” cried a voice almost over the swimmers’
heads. “Climb aboard, and make it snappy!
Those sharks will be back in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking up, Don and Red saw that a few strokes
would bring them within reach of the plane’s starboard
pontoon. So skillfully had the pilot maneuvered
his craft in the choppy waves that he was now drifting
past almost within arm’s reach. The man’s head and
arms were just visible through the cabin door which
he had slid back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don gripped the pontoon’s wet surface, heaved himself
up, and reached an arm down to Red Pennington.
His revolver was back in its shoulder holster, but the
bulge of it was plain, he knew, under his wet blouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those sharks nearly got us at that!” he observed,
imitating Corba’s whining tones. “We’ve been shootin’
at ’em since daylight, but they was gettin’ uglier every
second. An’ then that boat put off from the <em>Gatoon</em>.
Between it and the sharks, we wouldn’t have lasted five
minutes longer!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know all that, sailor!” snapped the pilot, glancing
back at the approaching lifeboat. “Stow the gab and
climb up here, so I can take off. They’ve got rifles in
that boat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Muttering under his breath, the fake Corba clambered
into the cabin, with his dripping companion at
his heels. As they did so, the seaplane’s motor burst
into full-throated sound. Gracefully the ship circled,
straightened out over the slapping wave tops, and took
off into the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, Mink!” called the pilot above the motor’s
steady roar. “They tell me you’re good with a machine
gun. If you want some practice, move over and man
that turret piece!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Okay!” replied Red Pennington, taking the role of
the gorilla seaman. “But wot’s the idea now? We ain’t
gonna attack the <em>Gatoon</em> all by ourselves, are we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The seaplane listed steeply in a sharp bank. As it
swung back toward the drifting yacht, the pilot
laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going to put a few holes in that lifeboat, just
for the fun of it!” he said. “I’ll give ’em a burst from
the wing guns, and you finish the job as we leave ’em
astern.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This job,” cut in Don Winslow’s voice, “is already
finished, pilot! Ease over and give me those controls,
or take a bullet through your ribs!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Scorpion pilot stiffened under the hard pressure
of Don’s gun muzzle. His lips drew back in an animal
snarl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not Corba!” he grated, as the young Navy
Commander pulled back on the joystick. “And this
other guy isn’t Mink. What’s the game, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington’s revolver prodded gently between
the man’s shoulder blades, as Don banked the seaplane
for a fast climb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a couple of Navy lads taking over for Uncle
Sam,” the grinning lieutenant answered. “Your precious
pals, Mink and Corba are locked up in the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
brig. That’s where we’re going to put you, if
we’re lucky in the coming dogfight.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c010'>XIII<br /> <br /><i>WINGS OF DESTRUCTION</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Scorpion pilot sat chewing his lips in silence,
while Red tied his wrists behind him. Mixed anger and
admiration showed on the man’s darkly handsome face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you mean you’re going to shoot it out with our
bombers, you’re a couple of suicidal nuts!” he exclaimed
finally. “They’ll outnumber you three to one,
and they all mount one-pounder guns, firing through a
hollow prop shaft. Who do you guys think you are, to
buck odds like that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don pushed the sturdy ship to its steepest possible
climb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See that other plane, right above us?” he asked. “It’s
ours, and it’s armed like this one, with guns fore and
aft. The odds won’t be too bad for us, when your three
ships show up. And if they don’t get here pretty quick
they’ll run into some more of the United States Navy.
There’s a squadron of fast attack bombers due here in
half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is going to be just half an hour too late!”
remarked Red Pennington in a strained voice. “Here
come the Scorpion bombers right on our tail! And—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“SC-25, acknowledge!” blared a voice from the seaplane’s
radio. “Ahoy, Count Borg! Explain presence of
second seaplane. Also, why <em>Gatoon</em> has steam up. Is
anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s response was instantaneous. In a
flash he realized that the question he’d heard came
from the leading bomber. His hand darted to a switch
just below the plane’s radio dials.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Borg speaking!” he said, in excellent imitation of
his captive’s voice. “Second seaplane is okay. <em>Gatoon</em>
appears defenseless except for rifles on deck. Come
ahead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still climbing, Don Winslow’s captured seaplane was
already above the Scorpion ships. They were, he saw,
closing up on a course that would bring them directly
over the <em>Gatoon</em> at about three thousand feet. Not fearing
the gunboat’s crippled anti-aircraft, they were going
to dive bomb—from a height that would insure
direct hits!</p>

<p class='c009'>A plan of attack grew swiftly in the young commander’s
mind. It would require perfect timing, and if
it failed....</p>

<p class='c009'>But this was not the moment to think of failure.
Circling back Don headed for the first enemy ship just
as it commenced its deadly bombing dive.</p>

<p class='c009'>The seaplane’s air speed mounted. Under full throttle
it plunged to intercept the Scorpion bomber.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as a crash seemed certain, twin streams of fire
ripped from Don’s forward guns. In the same split second
he zoomed, bringing the second and third Scorpion
planes briefly in front of his sights.</p>

<p class='c009'>On, up and over in a complete loop he flew the
snarling little ship. As yet he was unable to see the
effect of his surprise attack. Had he crippled one or
more of the enemy, or had his bullets missed their vital
spots?</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s answers came all in a bunch, as he leveled out,
less than three thousand feet above the sea. Directly
below him a heavy concussion rocked the air. White
water geysered upward alongside the <em>Gatoon</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first enemy plane had pancaked, and had been
blown to bits by its own bomb load. But the others?</p>

<p class='c009'>A row of bullet holes appeared suddenly in Don’s
left wing surface, creeping toward the cabin. As Don
zoomed, a dial on his instrument board smashed to bits.</p>

<p class='c009'>The machine gun in the plane’s after turret fired two
short bursts, followed by Red Pennington’s shout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two of ’em, diving at us from port and starboard!”
yelped the lieutenant. “They’ve got us bracketed—”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sudden jerk of his safety belt cut off Red’s
speech, as Don threw his ship into a barrel roll. It was
a desperate attempt to dodge the deadly cross-fire of
the two enemy planes until he could bring his own
guns to bear.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now another ship had joined the dogfight.
Michael Splendor’s open seaplane, diving from ten
thousand feet, unleashed a stream of bullets at the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming out of his roll at barely a hundred feet, Don
climbed his ship in a furious effort to get back in the
fight. But already the Scorpion pilots had had enough.
One after another, they fluttered down like wounded
birds, their wings and fuselages pierced in a hundred
places.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both managed to take the water safely, though they
began to sink a moment later. Their crews plunged
overboard, swimming toward the <em>Gatoon</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately a boat was lowered by the yacht. Glancing
down Don Winslow cut his throttle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll land on the other side of the <em>Gatoon</em>, Red,
and taxi in under the stern. Splendor will moor his
plane near the bow until they hoist it aboard, and....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait, Don!” Red Pennington cried sharply. “Splendor’s
waggling his wings to signal us. He’s trying to tell
us something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow, banking in a slow turn squinted out
over the sunlit ocean. Against the horizon, just over the
tail of the other seaplane appeared a V-shaped group
of dots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the Navy squadron we radioed for!” the young
commander chuckled. “I’d forgotten all about them,
Red! And, say—will those boys be peeved at having
missed the fight!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was still grinning at the thought when he set the
captured seaplane down on the bumpy water, in a
cloud of spray. His expression changed, however, as the
craft developed a sharp list to port, which grew steeper
every second.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hey, Skipper!” cried Red Pennington, in alarm.
“Those bullets must have made a sieve of our left
pontoon. The wing’s goin’ to 'catch a crab’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke, the left wing tip caught a wave and
went under. The whole plane shuddered, swung about
and lost the remainder of its speed. Another wave
slapped loudly against the listing fuselage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow unsnapped his safety belt and faced
around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Water’ll be coming through those holes under our
feet in a moment,” he said tersely. “We’d better unlash
our prisoner and get him out of here, quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye-aye, Skipper!” gulped Red, bending over the
Scorpion pilot. “I made him fast on the deck here,
seeing there were only two safety belts, and—great
guns, Don! He’s wounded! Bleeding from the head!
Help me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whipping a seaman’s knife from under his blouse,
Don quickly cut the lashings which held the unconscious
man. Turning, he slid open the metal door of
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go through, Red, and wait for me to pass him
out,” the young commander said. “The fellow’s still
breathing. Put on your life belt first, and make it
snappy. This crate’s going to end over in a minute!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red obeyed instantly. Without waiting even to fasten
the life belt, he plunged through the open door into
the water. There, clinging to the fuselage, he waited
for the pilot’s body to be passed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>It came, suddenly heaved through the wave washed
opening, <em>with Don’s life belt lashed in place</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>Startled, Red Pennington lost his grip, and drifted
free. A second glance at the white face bobbing above
the cork belt made the man’s identity certain. It was
the pilot, all right. But why didn’t Don come?</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Red could more than shout his friend’s name,
the seaplane listed more sharply than ever, forcing the
cabin door under water. Don Winslow was trapped
inside. He could still dive down through the doorway
and swim clear, Red thought, but the air in the cabin
now wouldn’t last for long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’s hurt, or caught in there!” Red groaned, stroking
back to the half-submerged fuselage. “If he weren’t
he’d be out by now. There’s just one way to get him,
and if that fails, we’ll both go down together!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slipping out of his unfastened life belt, he dived
under the plane’s wave-battered fuselage, groping for
the door. A moment later he found it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cabin was dark, half full of water, and almost
upside down. It took a few seconds for Red to get his
bearings. As his eyes got accustomed to the dim light,
he made out the pale blur of Don Winslow’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young commander was clinging weakly to a
seat, his eyes closed. As Red Pennington reached him,
he stirred and mumbled vaguely, but did not release
his grip on the seat. A bloody gash on his temple explained
his half-conscious condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Must have struck his head, just before the plane
turned over!” the stout lieutenant groaned. “Come on,
Don, old man! Leggo that seat, and lemme take you
out. Leggo, I say! This plane is sinkin’ lower every
minute!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s fingers were locked as if in a death
grip. By main force Red pried them loose and dragged
his friend down toward the submerged door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only he doesn’t breathe in a couple lungfuls of
water!” the worried lieutenant muttered, “but I’ve got
to take that chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shock of cold water closing over his head seemed
to rouse Don’s fighting instincts. Halfway through the
doorway, he clutched at the jamb and got a grip. Red,
also under water, struggled until he thought his lungs
would burst.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just in time, Don’s muscles relaxed. With his last
strength Red Pennington dragged him free and up to
the surface. Then, all at once, strong hands were hauling
the two half-drowned officers into a boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next thing Don Winslow knew, he was back in
his own berth aboard the <em>Gatoon</em>, with Michael Splendor,
Red, and the ship’s doctor crowding the little
stateroom. His head still ached from the wallop he’d
got inside the plane’s cabin, but the bandage which
the doctor had just applied felt cool and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, Doc,” he grinned, trying to sit up, “who was it
that beaned me this time?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c010'>XIV<br /> <br /><i>THE MYSTERIOUS CAPTIVE</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was the medical officer who actually spilled the
story of Red’s heroic act, in dragging Don from the
sinking seaplane. The stocky lieutenant himself would
never have let the real facts be known. He hated to be
made a hero. As it was, he could only shake his head
and scowl while the ship’s doctor heaped praises upon
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor didn’t leave anything out. He had been
in the boat which put off to the seaplane from the
<em>Gatoon</em>, and he’d seen about all there was to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>He described how Red had thrown off his life belt
and dived under the sinking plane. He told how helpless
the boat’s crew felt, when they got there and
found neither Red nor Don.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two of the sailors had kicked off their shoes, ready
to dive in after the missing officers, when suddenly the
lieutenant’s red head broke surface. He was gasping for
breath, and the commander was completely out when
they were pulled aboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the excitement, said the medical officer, the Scorpion
pilot, floating unconscious in his life belt, was
almost forgotten. Now, everybody aboard ship was
saying that Lieutenant Pennington rated a gold medal,
and....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Red, you old porpoise!” broke in Don Winslow, sitting
bolt upright. “Give me your flipper, and stop making
faces like a seasick 'boot’! I’ll get square with you
some day by saying <em>your</em> life—don’t worry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red met his commander’s handclasp with a crushing
grip, his embarrassment suddenly gone. He knew
that Don would never try to thank him outright, or
praise him in words for an act of simple loyalty. Their
friendship went too deep for that sort of thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, Doc,” said Don, “I’m going to jump into
a uniform and go out on deck. I see we’re under way
again; and I want to talk with Captain Riggs about
safeguarding the ship between here and Port-au-Prince.
Probably there’ll be no second attack, but it’s better to
be prepared.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The medical officer protested. He said Don had suffered
a slight concussion, along with a scalp wound.
He warned that moving about could bring on a fever.
But he might as well have talked to the ship’s mainmast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don was hurrying into his clothes even before the
doctor had finished speaking. He was feeling better
every minute, he declared, and he wasn’t going to stay
below for a mere bump on the head!</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke there came a knock on the door. It was
Lieutenant Darnley with a queer piece of news. The
prisoner Corba had been asking urgently for Commander
Winslow and he refused to say why.
Lieutenant Darnley thought that if the commander were well
enough....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be with you in two shakes, Lieutenant,” Don
assured the <em>Gatoon’s</em> executive officer. “That lad Corba
knows a lot more than he has told us yet. If he’s ready
to spill something interesting, I’ll be glad to listen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were only two roomy cells in the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
brig. With the rescued crews of the Scorpion airplanes,
they were crowded to capacity. Corba and Mink shared
their cell with the pilot of the seaplane who had recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don, standing before the cell door with Red and the
other two officers, noted the pilot’s makeshift head
bandage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to tend that man’s wound right away,
Doctor!” the young commander said sharply. “He’s an
enemy, in the service of a criminal chief, but he’s a
human being all the same.... Master-at-arms! Bring
that prisoner along with Corba, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later, both prisoners were led out, handcuffed.
The doctor took the wounded man under
guard to the sick bay while Don moved off out of earshot
with the shifty-eyed Corba.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red, glancing down the forecastle, caught the look
of amazed interest on Don Winslow’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That guy Corba must be giving him some potent
dope!” he remarked in an undertone. “I’d give a lot to
know what he’s saying!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, Pennington,” Lieutenant Darnley
agreed. “Commander Winslow isn’t excited easily, I’ve
noticed, but he’s sure getting that way now. Looks as if
Corba was shooting the works!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s air of mystery, as he returned with
Corba, did nothing to allay Red’s curiosity. Even when
the Scorpion agent had been returned to his cell, and
Lieutenant Darnley had answered a call to the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
bridge, the young commander refused to answer
questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along to the sick bay,” he told the red-haired
lieutenant. “We’ll see how sawbones is progressing
with his latest patient.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the two officers entered that portion of the
<em>Gatoon’s</em> sick bay which served as an operating room,
the handcuffed pilot was sitting in a chair under a
strong electric light. A portion of his scalp had been
shaved, and the medical officer was sterilizing the raw
furrow left by a glancing bullet. One of the slugs which
had pierced the seaplane’s cabin had nearly snuffed out
the Scorpion flyer’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the first chance either Don or Red had had
to examine their captive’s features. Strangely enough,
they were not those of a criminal. If it had not been for
the man’s wildly staring eyes and look of pained bewilderment,
they would have been almost handsome.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was something hauntingly familiar, too, about
the man’s face and build. Studying them, Red decided
he had seen the fellow—or his double—somewhere,
and not so long ago!</p>

<p class='c009'>If Don Winslow had the same notion, he didn’t mention
it. He waited until the doctor had finished work.
Only when the armed boatswain’s mate stepped forward
to take the prisoner back, Don stopped him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave the patient here, and give me the key to his
handcuffs!” he told the surprised guard. “I’ll be responsible
for him. You may return to your post outside the
brig.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a puzzled “Aye-aye, sir!” the guard departed.
Don closed the door and turned to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” he asked bluntly, looking the man
square in the eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“André, Count Borg,” the fellow replied mechanically.
“I am a licensed pilot and a native of Listonia....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Snap out of it, man!” barked Don Winslow, stepping
closer. “Do you know what you’ve got on your
wrists? Take a good look!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dazedly Borg’s eyes dropped to the steel handcuffs,
as if seeing them for the first time. With a harsh cry
he leaped to his feet, his lips drawn back in a snarl of
fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does this mean?” he shouted, wrenching at
the clanking chain. “You dare to handcuff me like a
common criminal? What right have you to confine
me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down!” thundered Don Winslow, forcing the
man back into his chair. “You are under arrest, Count
Borg, in connection with a plot to destroy the United
States Navy gunboat <em>Gatoon</em>. Following the orders of
your criminal chief, the Scorpion, you picked up two
men in life belts—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Don!” burst in Red Pennington. “The guy
knows all that. Why not get down to brass tacks and
make him tell something worth while—for instance,
where the Scorpion has his headquarters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A wild laugh from the prisoner interrupted at this
point. Pounding his manacled hands against his knees,
the man who called himself Count Borg rocked back
and forth in hysterical mirth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mad! Mad!” he choked. “We are all mad and
locked up in the crazyhouse! One talks about scorpions
and life belts; another raves about brass tacks! But nobody
tells me how I got here, and I—I cannot remember....”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a groan the fellow raised his hands to his
temples. Shifting from clear, unaccented English, he
began muttering to himself in some harsh, foreign
tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The medical officer reached for a hypodermic needle,
but Don Winslow seized his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get him a glass of cold water, Doc,” the young
commander advised. “This man isn’t crazy. He just
thinks he’s nuts, because....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pulling the doctor over to the sink, Don whispered
rapidly in the other’s ear. Their conference lasted two
or three minutes, long enough to get the goat of Lieutenant
Red Pennington, who was about fed up on
being a mystified onlooker.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the doctor returned with the water, his manner
was briskly professional.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me, Count Borg,” he said, “just what is the
last thing you remember doing, before you woke up
in the brig half an hour ago? If there has been some
mistake in your identity your answer will clear the
matter up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wild look on the prisoner’s face was now gone.
In its place was a puzzled frown, and his whole manner
had quieted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There certainly <em>has</em> been a mistake, gentlemen,” he
replied. “But to answer your question—the last thing
I recall is walking up Cherry Street toward Brooklyn
Bridge, about half past one last night. I remember hearing
stealthy footsteps behind me, coming closer. After
that, everything is a blank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a queer silence following Borg’s words.
Finally, the medical officer broke it after meeting Don’s
glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what,” he asked in a strained voice, “would
you say the date was yesterday? I mean, the day of the
month and the year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—er,” responded the prisoner slowly, “April
fourteenth, nineteen thirty-three. Am I right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wrong, by seven years, my friend!” Don returned,
stooping to unlock the handcuffs. “Your memory has
done another blackout, Count Borg! The first one was
when a thug knocked you out on Cherry Street, New
York, in nineteen thirty-three. The last one happened
this morning when you were wounded in the head by
a machine gun bullet. Since you’ve evidently forgotten
your whole life between those dates, there’s no reason
for treating you now as a dangerous criminal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, Skipper!” pleaded Lieutenant Pennington,
seizing Don Winslow’s arm. “Maybe this guy, Count
Borg, isn’t nuts; but <em>I’m</em> gonna be if you keep on doin’
and sayin’ things that don’t make sense! First you get
an earful of hot dope from Corba, and start actin’
mysterious. Then you get chummy with a dangerous
enemy agent. He raves and hollers like a maniac; so
you decide he isn’t crazy but only thinks he is. Now
you unlock his handcuffs, and tell him what happened
to him back in nineteen thirty-three just as if you’d seen
it. Have a heart, Skipper! My anchor’s draggin’ and I’m
goin’ aground fast. If you won’t tell me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Belay, sailor!” laughed Don. “You’ll get the whole
yarn in due time. Right now, suppose you go hunt up
Michael Splendor and Captain Riggs. Say I’ll meet you
all in the captain’s quarters about fifteen minutes from
now to talk over something of the highest importance.
Tell Mercedes to come along, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nodding glumly, Red Pennington moved to the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell ’em,” he replied. “But you’d better break it
to them a lot easier than you’ve done to me. I’m driftin’
onto an uncharted coast, and my compass has gone
sour on me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment Red had gone, Don Winslow turned
to Count Borg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no time now to explain everything, Count,”
he said tersely. “You must simply take my word for
the moment, and believe that we mean to help you out
of your present strange predicament. The facts are
briefly these:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the past seven years you have been associated with
a criminal organization which threatens the peace of
many countries. This morning, you were piloting a
plane which was captured with two others, during an
attempt to destroy a United States Navy gunboat. You
are now aboard that same gunboat under arrest for
conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I remember nothing of that!” protested Count
Borg, with a look of keen distress. “If what you say is
true, I must have lost my reason, as well as my memory,
during those years which are now a blank. I am not
naturally a criminal. You must believe that, Commander—er—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Winslow,” nodded Don. “I am inclined to believe
you, Count, and to test your good faith, I shall ask you
to help, so far as you can, in tracking down your former
criminal associates. Are you willing to co-operate
with the Navy in this fight before your case comes to
trial?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, Commander Winslow!” exclaimed Borg,
rising to grasp Don’s hand. “I’ll be grateful for any
chance to undo the damage of those criminal years,
when I was not myself! But, tell me, what on earth can
I do to help, without a memory?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First,” answered Don Winslow with an enigmatic
smile, “you can shave off your moustache!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime a curious and impatient group
awaited Don Winslow’s appearance in Captain Riggs’
cabin. To while away the minutes, Mercedes and Red
discussed the recent air battle, and the disappointment
of the Navy fliers in arriving too late for the scrap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They did accomplish one thing, though,” put in
Captain Riggs. “That big bomber they call a flying
fortress brought us a couple of new parts for our anti-aircraft
guns. The gunner and his mates are mounting
them now, so we’ll not be helpless against another attack
between here and Port-au-Prince. Not that the
Scorpion is likely to strike again so soon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I quite agree with ye, Captain!” said Michael Splendor.
“We’ll be in port by nightfall, and from there 'tis
but a short run by motorcar to my villa in the hills.
Our friends can rest safely there and enjoy themselves,
until orders come from Washington.... By the way,
did you say the pilot of that seaplane was called Count
Borg?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what the guy called himself, Mr. Splendor,”
replied Red, disgustedly. “Don seemed to believe him,
but I’d think twice before takin’ the word of a nut like
that. He sure was raving!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was he, now?” murmured the cripple with a sly
wink. “Indeed, Lieutenant, I should say a man with a
bullet dent in his skull might be excused for a bit of
ravin’. However, if the man is Count Borg, I can tell
you something about him. He is one of the aces in
Scorpia’s evil organization—a man of great resource
and daring and very useful to his chief. I have never
seen him, personally, but while I was a captive of Cho-San
and his fiendish master, I heard Borg’s name mentioned
frequently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he’s one of their 'key’ men,” put in Mercedes,
“his capture is going to put a crimp into the Scorpion’s
style, isn’t it, Mr. Splendor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve already put quite a crimp into the Scorpion’s
style, bad 'cess to him!” snorted the man in the wheel
chair. “In the last thirty-six hours, we have seized some
of his most valuable inventions, blown up his submarine
base, arrested three of his agents aboard this ship,
foiled his plans to destroy the <em>Gatoon</em>, shot down three
of his fast bombing planes, and captured five members
of their crews alive. That does not mean, however, that
we have crippled his power for evil! Men and machines
can be replaced, for Scorpia’s wealth is immense.
No, me friends! We have struck no vital blow as yet;
but I’m thinkin’, perhaps, through this Count Borg....
Ah, Commander! I was wonderin’ when ye would join
us and tell us what ye’ve found out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning about, he motioned the newcomer to the
empty chair beside that of Captain Riggs. Red Pennington
got up and closed the skylight. Mercedes moved to
the other end of the cabin locker beside Michael Splendor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re pale, Don!” the girl said anxiously, as the
tall young officer took his seat. “Are you sure you feel
able to be up, with your wounded head? And your eyes
are <em>queer</em>! As if you were looking at me for the first
time in your life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice which spoke those two words was Don’s;
yet there was a strange note in it, which shocked everyone
in the cabin to attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” it continued hollowly, “I am not Don
Winslow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“OH!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercedes’ shriek cut the horrified silence like a knife.
All at once she was beside the young man, gazing fixedly
into his eyes, as if to read the brain behind them.
While the others watched her, fascinated, she stepped
slowly back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No!” she sobbed, covering her face with her
hands. “You are not Don. Oh! What right have
you....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Skipper!” pleaded Red Pennington, laying a hand
on his friend’s shoulder. “Come on back to your berth!
I was afraid that would get you feverish.... Captain
Riggs, help me take him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“WAIT, GENTLEMEN!” cried the young officer
rising suddenly to his feet. “I am sorry to distress you,
but I have been simply obeying orders. Commander
Winslow is standing there in the doorway!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Instinctively all eyes followed his pointing finger,
only to stare in stark unbelief.</p>

<p class='c009'>There <em>could not</em> be two Don Winslows. Yet there
in the doorway stood the young officer’s double, complete
in every detail. Even the paleness and the white
bandage about the temple were reproduced in each
figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a trick!” cried Captain Riggs hoarsely. “The
Scorpion has hypnotized us—or tried to! But there’s
one way to break any spell!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tugging a blunt nosed pistol from his pocket, the
<em>Gatoon’s</em> master would have fired at the man in the
doorway, had not Michael Splendor driven his wheel
chair between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop it, Riggs!” bellowed the gray-haired cripple.
“If ye value your own life, not to mention Commander
Winslow’s, lower that weapon, sir! Miss Colby is right!
The gentleman at the table is a stranger; but the man
here beside me is Don Winslow himself, may heaven
preserve him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Impulsively, both Mercedes and Red had to feel of
the real Don’s hands and features to make sure he
was not a dream figure, as Riggs still seemed to think.
After that, Red stepped across to the man by the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you now, mister!” he grinned sheepishly.
“You’re the one the doctor was working on in the sick
bay. The man who said he was a count! You had a
moustache on then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Count Borg is my real title, Lieutenant,” smiled the
other. “Commander Winslow wished me to impersonate
him, in order to test out our strange likeness. It
seems that even our voices are much the same in pitch
and timbre. You see, if I can impersonate <em>him</em> so successfully
as to fool his closest friends, he should be
able just as easily to trick those who know <em>me</em>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c010'>XVI<br /> <br /><i>DANGER AND A WOMAN</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“It was Corba who put me wise to that resemblance,”
Don told the astonished group after Borg had left.
“That radioman is a born traitor, and he’s figuring
every possible way to cross up his old pals in hope of
getting in right with us. He suggested that I might use
my likeness to Count Borg as a means of spying on
Scorpia’s activities. It certainly looks like a hot idea;
but I’d want your opinion of it, Mr. Splendor, before
going farther with any plans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will take a bit of study, I can see that,” replied
the veteran Intelligence man. “But first of all, Commander,
why ye think Count Borg is not planning a
clever trap for ye? He’s too bright a man to be a common
double-crosser like Corba. Mind ye, he has been
one of the Scorpion’s most trusted agents. Considerin’
that, it strikes me he fell in with your impersonation
scheme a bit too quickly. It’s not like him to play
traitor to his chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which is the very reason I believe he will be loyal
to our cause now!” retorted Don, his eyes narrowing
thoughtfully. “You see, Mr. Splendor, our man has been
a victim of <em>amnesia</em>. The bullet wound he received this
morning restored his memory of everything that
happened until the night of April fourteenth, nineteen
thirty-three. At that time his skull was fractured by a
thug’s blackjack. Of the seven years between then and
now he has not the slightest recollection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Amazin’, if true!” muttered the cripple, meeting
Don’s level look. “Are ye sure, Commander, that this
<em>is</em> amnesia, and not another clever piece of actin’?
Count Borg is no ordinary man, remember. He’d be
quite capable of plannin’ a trick like that from the
moment he found himself aboard ship!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He couldn’t fake amnesia well enough to fool an
expert,” Don pointed out. “Our medical officer happens
to have made a special study of brain disorders, and
he says this is a genuine case. Doc thinks that Borg’s
first injury changed his whole character. Recalling little
except his name, the man became an obedient tool of
Scorpia. He remembered no other friends, no other
life; and his naturally keen brain was completely at the
service of his criminal master. Now, of course, he is
horrified at the idea of having been one of that crowd.
He wants to make up in some way for the damage he
has done as a Scorpion agent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what luck it would be, Don,” put in Mercedes,
“if Count Borg <em>should</em> start to remember his life as one
of Scorpia’s aces! He might give us enough information
to clean up the entire organization in one swoop. Of
course that sort of luck is too good to be real!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid it is, my dear,” said Splendor. “However,
I think we have a chance of getting most, if not
all, of the evidence we need, thanks to this resemblance
between Don Winslow and his captive. Do ye recall
the code message we discovered at the submarine base—the
one which Corba later stole from your stateroom,
Commander? Well, I had the master-at-arms search
all five of our new prisoners before ye were on deck
this mornin’. And every last one of them had the same
code message tucked away in his clothing! Ye see what
that means?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hmmm! It looks as if the Scorpion were calling all
his forces together at San Francisco for some big job,
if you ask me,” Don answered soberly. “That would
be the very thing to get in on—a general conference
of Scorpia’s operatives. If I got out of it alive, we’d
have enough evidence to hamstring the organization’s
power for years to come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all very well, gentlemen,” growled Captain
Riggs, picking up his hat, “but I believe you’re going
to find some pretty big difficulties in the way. Unless
Borg recovers his memory and gives you the Scorpia
passwords, not to mention a lot of other information,
I fear your disguise won’t get you very far, Commander.
You’ll excuse me if I leave you now to take my watch
on deck!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a brusque nod the <em>Gatoon’s</em> master closed the
cabin door behind him. Mercedes looked across at Don,
her eyes dark with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid Captain Riggs is right about that,” she
said. “Oh, Don, I hope you’ll not attempt anything
so risky as to pass yourself off for the count! There are
a thousand details on which your ignorance would trip
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a way out of that difficulty, Skipper,” spoke
up Red Pennington. “Suppose we give out a story that
Borg has escaped. Actually of course, he’ll stay in plain
sight dressed in your uniform. You’ll be the one who
disappears and shows up in San Francisco as Count
Borg. You’ll pretend that your memory is partly
blacked out by your head wound and that will account
for any slips you make, like forgetting people and passwords
that Borg used to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great stuff, sailor!” cried Don Winslow, leaping
up to pound Red enthusiastically on the back. “That
story will have enough truth in it to convince the most
suspicious Scorpion operatives. What do you think of
it, Mr. Splendor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man in the wheel chair wagged his gray head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“'Tis a clever plan—very clever indeed,” he admitted.
“As a matter of fact, I can think of only one person
in Scorpia’s ranks whom it would not fool. When I
was stationed in San Francisco it was reported that a
certain beautiful young girl was in love with Count
Borg....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A woman!” cried Mercedes Colby. “That tears it,
Don! Remember, I was the only one of us who knew
that Count Borg was not you? A woman’s instinct
will tell her the truth, in spite of the most perfect disguise.
If you meet this girl, as you surely will, she’ll
know you’re not her lover. By the way, what is her
name, Mr. Splendor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They call her the Lotus,” chuckled the gray-haired
cripple. “Some say that she is part Chinese, others that
she is of pure white blood, brought up by Chinese who
kidnapped her in infancy. All agree that she is very
lovely and <em>very</em> clever having been trained by Cho-San
himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she is all the more dangerous!” Mercedes protested.
“Please, Don! Give up this wild notion of putting
yourself into Scorpia’s power, for that is just what you
would be doing! You might be able to disguise your
identity from men, but never from a woman in love!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe,” suggested Red Pennington, “this gal Lotus
isn’t in love with Count Borg any more. A lot of things
have happened since you were stationed in 'Frisco, Mr.
Splendor. And a dame like that <em>could</em> change her mind,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, 'tis entirely possible, Lieutenant,” the older
man agreed. “I’ll think over the whole proposition
between now and the time we drop anchor in Port-au-Prince.
On the way to my villa in the mountains we
can talk again, me friends. Will that suit you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It ought to, Mr. Splendor!” smiled Mercedes rising
from her chair. “In the meantime, Don and Red are
going to rest undisturbed, if I have to stand guard at
the door. After swimming all night and fighting all
morning, they’ve got to get some sleep!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With sleepy grins, the two young officers steered
obediently for their stateroom. Tumbling into their
berths, clothes and all, they knew nothing more until
the cabin steward called them for mess that evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ship had already dropped anchor in the harbor
of Port-au-Prince, and Don and his friends were eager
to go ashore at the first possible moment. After a
hastily eaten meal, they shook hands with the <em>Gatoon’s</em>
officers, and stepped into the gunboat’s launch.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the dock Splendor’s pilot, Panama, met them with
a powerful car. For ten minutes they dodged and
twisted through the city’s quaint old streets, then struck
into a fine, smooth road leading toward the hills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, me friends,” sighed Michael Splendor, as the
big twelve cylinder car picked up speed, “'tis great
to be gettin’ home again after the last few days of
excitement! I’m well along in years now, and risks
are not so thrilling as they used to be. I’d rather be
sittin’ by me own fireplace in peace and comfort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Panama’s amused chuckle drifted back from the front
seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t act that way, sir, when you were slamming
bullets into those two Scorpion bombers!” he
observed. “And when some of their slugs ripped into
us, it just made you all the happier—to judge by what
I heard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisht, lad!” growled the veteran, scowling ferociously.
“'Twas naught but the Irish blood of me enjoyin’
the scrap. A true son of Erin always howls when
he fights; but me brain was tellin’ me all the while
that war is a horrible business, even when you’re fightin’
to stop it. And that reminds me, Commander! I’ve
made certain arrangements to further your scheme for
impersonatin’ Count Borg!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c010'>XVII<br /> <br /><i>ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“You mean,” asked Mercedes, as the little party sat
sipping their after dinner coffee on Splendor’s wide
veranda, “that you actually approve of Don’s risky
plan? To me it seems like taking a hundred-to-one
chance. There are so many traps he might walk into
whichever way he turns!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye, there’s no denyin’ the dangers,” Michael Splendor
agreed solemnly. “But there are ways of lessening
them, I think. Take that treacherous radioman, for
instance, he is only too anxious to talk, and he knows
a great deal that will be useful to Don Winslow. The
other captives have not been persuaded to loosen up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ve interviewed them all?” queried Red
Pennington, in surprise. “Gee, you must have been busy
while Don and I were pounding our ears this afternoon!
But how’re we gonna get hold of Corba again?
I heard Captain Riggs sayin’ that he was shovin’ off
again in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so he is,” said Splendor. “But tonight, some
time durin’ the wee, small hours, another closed car
will be comin’ out here from Port-au-Prince. Inside
of it will be Corba and our new friend, Count Borg,
under guard, of course. We’ll have a talk with them
tomorrow, providin’ Headquarters okays Commander
Winslow’s scheme. We should be hearin’ any minute
from the phone call I put through to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke, there came the faint ringing of a telephone
bell, somewhere in the villa’s spacious interior.
A moment later a soft-footed native servant approached
Michael Splendor’s chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>C’est pour, M’sieu’</em> Don Winslow!” the man murmured
in soft Haitian speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s your call. Commander!” the young officer’s
host interpreted. “I put it through to Captain Holding
in your name. Tell him the whole scheme as ye worked
it out, and add that I’m helpin’ ye with the details.
Here’s hopin’ ye persuade him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sober nod Don followed the servant through
the wide doorway into the house. When he had gone,
Mercedes turned to Splendor with a troubled frown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know,” she said, “that this telephone
conversation won’t be overheard? There is such a thing
as wire tapping, you know. And couldn’t a radiophone
message be intercepted by anyone who turned in to the
right wave length? If the Scorpion’s agents should get
wind of Don’s plan, it would be worse than useless
to go ahead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your reasoning is excellent, my dear,” the man in
the wheel chair answered. “I believe, however, that the
chance of our friend’s words being overheard is less
than if he and Captain Holding were sitting in the
same room. Commander Winslow is sitting this minute
in a soundproofed booth. The wire is connected with
me own private radio room, where it is hooked up
with a powerful radio beam transmitter. If an airplane
with its radio tuned just right should blunder into that
beam between here and Washington, the pilot might
do a bit of eavesdroppin’. But the chance is one in a
billion, I fancy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reassured, Mercedes sank back in her chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess it’s foolish for me to worry about such
things,” she admitted. “You seem to have thought of
every detail in advance, Mr. Splendor. I don’t see any
armed guards patrolling about, but I suppose we’re
safer here in your wild Haitian hills than we were on
the high seas, aboard the <em>Gatoon</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Enthusiastically Red Pennington took up the same
theme. He had seen enough of Michael Splendor’s
shrewd planning to believe the veteran capable of handling
any situation, on land or sea or in the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>That private beam radio was the last word in preparedness,
the chubby lieutenant stated. As for guards
about the premises, what good would they be, he asked,
if they simply strutted back and forth in plain sight
like any cop on a beat?</p>

<p class='c009'>Starting from there, he became really talkative. He
praised his host’s magnificent grounds and living quarters,
and especially his kitchen staff. In the meal they
had just eaten all Red’s dreams of earthly happiness
had come true, he declared. With a cook like that, he
didn’t see how Michael Splendor could bear to miss
a single meal at home!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, I’ve other duties than stuffin’ me face,
Lieutenant!” retorted the older man with a laugh. “I admit
that I do meself well, though, back here in the hills,
and 'tis a grand place to rest up after a long trip. I
hope ye and the Commander and Admiral Colby’s
daughter will enjoy your stay with me; be it long or
short!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid,” spoke Don Winslow from the doorway,
“that it’s going to be short, so far as I am concerned,
Mr. Splendor! I’ve just finished talking with Captain
Holding at the Navy Intelligence Office. He’s ordered
me to leave at once, by plane, for San Francisco!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—you mean, Don, he’s approved your taking
the place of Count Borg?” gasped Mercedes, starting
up from her chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, Skipper, I knew he’d do that!” Red Pennington
chimed in. “But what did he say about me? If
you’re bound for 'Frisco, I’m going right along with
you, y’know. You can’t scuttle a shipmate in mid-voyage!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There followed a lively argument, with Red and
Mercedes trying to beat down the protests of Don and
the crippled Intelligence chief. The latter pointed out,
quite logically, that two disguises would be more than
twice as dangerous as one. Besides there was no real
need, they said, for Red to risk his life as a bodyguard
for the pretended Count Borg. If Don <em>should</em> be discovered
in that disguise, a whole platoon of fighting
men couldn’t save his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the end, however, Red won his point. It was
agreed that he should accompany the pseudo Count
as his valet, at least as far as the Empire Hotel in San
Francisco. After they registered there, of course, anything
might happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>At present, the main task for all four friends lay in
getting the two young officers started on their long
flight to the West coast. Captain Holding had urged
haste, yet there were many things to be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among these was the job of pumping the Scorpion
radioman, Corba, for every scrap of information about
the real Count Borg. Michael Splendor volunteered to
do the pumping, so that Don and Red might rest up
for the hard trip ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, it was decided Panama would be overhauling
Splendor’s big, new cabin plane for a nonstop
flight. The following night it would be ready, in its
hangar behind the villa, for the supposed Count Borg
to “steal.” When that was done and the “escaping
prisoner” was well on his way, the alarm would be
spread. No mention, of course, would be made of Lieutenant
Red Pennington’s disappearance at the very same
time!</p>

<p class='c009'>With Don and Red taking turns at the cabin plane’s
controls, they should arrive at San Francisco fresh
enough for whatever adventures lay in store for them.
The plane would be abandoned outside the city. An
hour or two later, “Count Borg” would register at the
Empire Hotel, with his valet, “Penny,” and the dangerous
game would begin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c010'>XVIII<br /> <br /><i>THE DARK FIELD</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Two evenings later a heavy fog blanketed the San
Francisco waterfront, hiding its smelly wharves and
damp alleys under a dreary pall. A distant foghorn
sounded dismally above the lap-lap of harbor water
against wooden piles. Vaguely the blended roar of a
mighty city drifted seaward through the murk and
mist. It was a night for secrecy; for furtive business
which could not bear the light of day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the winding alleys of old Chinatown brooded a
heavy silence, spiced with queer oriental odors. It flowed
between the buildings like a deep, mysterious river.
It reached thick tentacles up a steeply sloping street to
close around a huge stone house.</p>

<p class='c009'>A high stone wall, clammy with the fog, surrounded
the lightless edifice. Within there seemed to be neither
sound nor life nor movement. Yet a sharp-eyed passer-by
might have noticed a tiny thread of light peeping
through the drawn curtain of a second floor window.</p>

<p class='c009'>At least the light was there, although blurred and
scarcely visible in the close-pressing fog.</p>

<p class='c009'>One thing no curious passerby could have guessed—the
luxurious richness of the room behind that drawn
curtain. Soft shaded lights spread their glow over satin
wall hangings, deep piled oriental rugs, and beautiful
costly furniture. The air was heavy with incense, sweet
but oppressive.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a table a young woman sat gazing at her reflection
in a large mirror. Clad in a loose, flowing gown of
silk, her figure was almost girlish. Her face beneath
its oriental coiffure had a fresh, flowerlike beauty which
deepened as she turned and spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suzette!” she murmured plaintively. “Do you think
I am as lovely tonight as I was three months ago?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A trimly uniformed maid appeared from an alcove
beyond the dressing table. Her bright eyes took in the
dark-haired girl in one swift, approving glance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But yes, Mademoiselle! You are even more beautiful
tonight!” she answered. “It is that little touch of
<em>tristesse</em> which make you so, I think. Is it because you
are impatient to see Count Borg again after three long
months? Ah, Mademoiselle Lotus! You cannot fool
the little French maid, Suzette!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a laugh, the girl called Lotus shrugged her
pretty shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, Suzette,” she retorted, “the Count is much
more charming than the desperadoes, white and yellow,
which surround us here....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sh-h-h! Please, Mademoiselle!” the maid whispered
sharply. “Please do not talk that way in this house. It
is not safe! To be sure, we <em>think</em> the others have all
gone out for the night, but all the same, there are
things even Mademoiselle must not say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, bother!” cried the younger woman, springing
up with small fists clenched in anger. “I know what
you mean, Suzette! And I am tired of measuring all
my words to suit the great Cho-San. I am sick of looking
out for eavesdroppers and spies—yes, <em>spies</em>—who
run to him with reports of all I say or do! Let me tell
you this, my little maid, if I ever find <em>you</em> have been
bearing tales about me, it will not be well for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stamping her slippered foot, Lotus turned to the window
and savagely flung up the lower sash. Through
the parted curtains she leaned out, drawing in deep
breaths of the foggy night air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Mademoiselle!” cried the little French maid in
a tone of keen distress. “Suzette have nevair bear the
tales to anyone. You do her a wrong to think she would—w’at
you call—double cross Mademoiselle. She only
warn you that Cho-San, he is jealous w’en you speak
of Count Borg!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jealous, is he?” spat the girl, whipping around to
face her maid. “But I don’t love Cho-San! I—I think
I am too young to be in love with anybody. I like Count
Borg, because he is young and handsome, and—well,
he’s <em>different</em>. Cho-San is a great man. He is older and
stronger and he has the ear of the Master. But sometimes
Cho-San forgets that he and Lotus are not of
the same race!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gently, yet with determination, Suzette took her mistress’
hand and led her back to the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mademoiselle excites herself too much!” she murmured,
picking up a brush and running it through
the girl’s shiny, dark hair. “Suzette, she know w’at is
the reason. You are wonder if Count André Borg have
make good his escape from Haiti. Evair since Monsieur
Michael Splendor broadcast the stealing of his
big cabin plane, the friends of Count Borg have wonder
if he will dare to fly straight here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’ll try, anyway, Suzette,” cried the girl. “He
knows that Cho-San has called a general meeting for
day after tomorrow night. André will be there unless
something terrible happens to him between here and
Haiti. Oh, it seems like years since I saw him last!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now it may be only hours till you see him
again,” murmured the little maid. “Oh, I know how
you feel, Mademoiselle! But now we must hurry, so
you will not be late at the appointment downtown
which Cho-San has made for you tonight. I heard him
tell you it was important.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>While Lotus was worrying over the whereabouts of
Count Borg, the Count’s double was speeding through
the night sky less than a hundred miles east of San
Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already Don Winslow was training himself mentally
for the part he was to play. In talking with Red
Pennington who occupied the co-pilot’s place in the big
cabin plane, he tried to imitate the very tone and accent
of Count Borg’s speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red, on the other hand, was training himself for the
part of Penny, the Count’s valet-to-be. Only for brief
periods during the trip had he dropped the pose of a
manservant, for he knew that his part must be played
to perfection from the moment they met the first Scorpion
agent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know the place we are supposed to land,
sir?” he queried in his most respectful tone. “Even if
one is acquainted with the city’s outskirts, it won’t be
easy to find an unlighted field at night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will all be taken care of, Penny,” replied the
pseudo Count Borg. “According to the last code message
we got from Haiti at least one man will be there
to meet us with a fast car. Undoubtedly he will light
a couple of ground flares as soon as he hears our motor
overhead. Anyhow, judging by the highway lights
ahead, we’re almost over the spot which Splendor described.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But supposing, sir,” objected “Penny,” “that one of
the Scorpion stations picked up Mr. Splendor’s broadcast
and was able to decode it! In that case perhaps the
man who is waiting for us will be a Scorpion agent
backed by an armed gang. If they <em>should</em> suspect anything
wrong they wouldn’t hesitate to rub us out and
ask questions later—not that gang!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The idea was startling enough as “Penny” expressed
it. But “Count Borg” showed no trace of nervousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course anything is possible with that gang, as
you call them,” he agreed; “but Navy secret codes
aren’t easily broken down, even by experts. Besides I’ve
got a feeling our number isn’t up yet—look, Red!
There are the ground flares being lighted now! Over
to starboard, and about two miles north. We’ll come
down just between them, and upwind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rough field lighted by the flares turned out to
be a sandy patch between two highways and far from
any lighted house. This much Don Winslow guessed as
he set his wheels down with a gentle bump. When he
had braked to a stop beyond the flares, both of them
were suddenly blacked out, leaving earth and sky pitch
dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so no chance-passing motor cop will see
lights and start to investigate, I guess,” remarked Red
Pennington, sliding back the plane’s sliding door. “We
wouldn’t want our arrival noted on the San Francisco
Police Blotter, would we, Don?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly!” smiled the young commander, switching
off the cabin light. “Out with you, now, shipmate!
There’s a car headed this way across the field. Keep
your hand on your automatic until we know who it is.
If it should be a Scorpion reception party, we won’t go
down without a battle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lightless car skidded to a dusty standstill ten feet
from the plane. Then only its head lamps flashed on,
and into their blinding radiance stepped a well-built
man in civilian clothes. Keeping both hands in sight, he
faced the darkened plane and spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Commander Winslow, you and the Lieutenant may
trust me without risk,” he said quietly. “I am Hammond,
from the San Francisco Office, and here are my
identification papers. This car is at your service along
with anything else you wish to ask for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Red was about to step out of the shadows, Don
elbowed him back. It was still possible that a Scorpion
machine gun was trained over the car’s rear door, ready
to fire at the sound of his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>He must make sure, without showing himself. Shielding
his mouth with a cupped hand, he threw his voice
along the plane’s fuselage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind the papers, Hammond,” he responded.
“A few words will do to show you have been in communication
with our friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The car’s spotlight showed Hammond’s smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wise precaution, sir!” he approved. “How’s this
for a set of passwords:—Captain Holding—beam radiophone—Count
Borg—Haiti—'Penny’—Michael
Splendor? Or do you want more?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c010'>XIX<br /> <br /><i>A LUCKY ENCOUNTER</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Pocketing his pistol, Don Winslow moved out into
the glow of the car’s lights.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks, Hammond!” he said simply, gripping the
other’s hand. “Your coming for us is going to simplify
a lot of things. Come on, Red—I mean, Penny! Michael
Splendor’s last message told us to leave the plane right
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the car cut back into the highway leading to the
city, Hammond leaned forward to speak to the driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drive slowly when you get inside the city’s limits,
Martin,” he said. “Swing around past Cho-San’s place
before you pull up at the office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaning back against the cushions, he addressed the
two young Intelligence officers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We got the whole story by beam radiophone,” he
explained. “That’s how we were able not only to meet
you gentlemen, but also to make certain other preparations
as well; such as an electric needle for giving you
a scar, like the little one Count Borg has just below his
cheek bone. You can only see that mark by a bright
light, but it’s one of the things his Scorpia friends are
going to look for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know about that, Hammond,” Don Winslow
answered. “Borg himself called my attention to it yesterday.
There’s the matter of his clothes, too. Borg has
always been a slick dresser, and he is supposed to have
escaped with a wad of Splendor’s cash. That means his
Scorpia pals will expect him to show up dressed like
a fashion plate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They will,” nodded Hammond. “Splendor broadcast
the story of 'Count Borg’s’ escape with his plane
and his dough. There’s no doubt the Scorpion and his
agents know about that. They’ll expect you to show up
at the meeting two nights from now, if not sooner.
They’ll find out about the plane having landed. Splendor’s
flying here tomorrow with Miss Colby on Captain
Holding’s orders. He’ll pretend he’s just trailing his
stolen plane....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Z-ZZZ-ZZZZ! PR-R-R-RRH!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden loud snore from Red Pennington drowned
out Hammond’s voice. The chunky lieutenant had
done his full share of the piloting since leaving Haiti,
and was letting weary Nature have her way now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll let him sleep,” chuckled Don, “until we get
to your office, Hammond. We can discuss everything
then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red’s slumber, however, was due to be rudely interrupted.
After skirting the edges of San Francisco’s old
Chinatown, the car turned up a steep hill at the top
of which stood the great stone-walled house of Cho-San.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to show you this place just in passing,
Commander,” Hammond was saying. “Cho-San lives
here like an Oriental prince, yet his only visible income
is from his curio shop down the hill. We know he’s a
big shot in the criminal organization of Scorpia, but we
can’t pin it on him. That job will be up to you, if you
live to finish it! Cho-San’s thugs will stop at nothing—”</p>

<p class='c009'>BANG!</p>

<p class='c009'>At the loud report, the car lurched sidewise, swayed
another twenty yards, and stopped. Red Pennington
awoke with a yell. Guns out, the three men in the back
seat peered through the bulletproof windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were just opposite the dark stone edifice, which
was the only building within a hundred yards. Could
a single shot from behind those misty walls have ripped
through one of the rear tires?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Don Winslow who answered the question in
all their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just an accidental blowout, I think,” he stated, putting
away his automatic. “There’s not enough light to
fire a shot with any accuracy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, sir!” muttered Hammond, following
Don through the door. “I guess I’m jittery just because
it happened right across from Cho-San’s stone fort.
Probably just an accident—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that the fort you mean?” gulped Red, with one
foot still on the running board. “Gee! If they’ve got
machine guns trained on us, isn’t it kinda foolish to
stick around?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean a fort in that sense, Lieutenant!” said
Hammond. “Cho-San’s rock pile here <em>looks</em> like a fort,
especially in the dark. If there’s any machine guns
inside, they won’t be aimed at us now.... But, say!
What’s that car pulling in ahead of us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A long, low hung, black car had boiled up the hill
behind them, only to stop ten paces beyond with a
squeal of gripping tires. The two young officers, with
Hammond and Martin, stiffened instinctively, hands
whipping to their pistols. For all they knew this might
be a gang car, filled with Scorpion killers.</p>

<p class='c009'>A door opened, and a man in uniform cap jumped
out. Swiftly he moved to the rear door, opened it, and
stood back waiting. From the dark interior appeared a
young woman in a white evening wrap, her dark hair
lighted by the flash of jewels. With a murmured word,
she turned away from the car, walking quickly toward
the house of Cho-San.</p>

<p class='c009'>The four men watching her relaxed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the girl they call the Lotus!” whispered
Hammond in Don Winslow’s ear. “She’s the one you’ll
have to look out for especially, Commander. Look!
What’s she up to, now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a low cry of pain, the girl had stumbled. Now
she stood swaying, as if about to fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s turned her ankle! I’m going to help her, Hammond,”
muttered Don. “You all stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other car, Don noted, was just driving away.
Reaching the girl’s side, he caught her arm firmly,
taking the weight off her injured foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw you trip,” he said, imitating Count Borg’s
smoother tone. “What luck that I was just across the
street!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“André! André!” gasped Lotus, leaning heavily
against him. “Is it really you? But yes! Your voice—your
touch on my arm! I know them, though your
face is queer in this light!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, little Lotus bud!” laughed Don, slipping
an arm about her shoulders. “You miss the moustache
I had to shave off. But your ankle must be paining you
a lot. Let me help you as far as the house!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the house, André!” cried the girl. “You mean
you’re not coming inside? Didn’t you come here to see
me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please—not so loud!” warned the pseudo Count.
“I can’t stop longer without making the men with me
suspicious. It was just the accident of a blowout that
made them stop here at all. I’ll explain everything
when I see you next—say tomorrow night, at the Empire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a long time to wait, André, when I haven’t
seen you for so long!” sighed Lotus, with a hint of
disappointment. “I guess you know best, though. Suppose
you meet me in the dining room, at that same
little table in the corner—remember?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At seven o’clock,” agreed Don, as the girl turned
with one gloved hand on the gate latch. “And I’m
awfully glad your ankle isn’t really injured! Good
night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Returning across the street, he found that Hammond’s
chauffeur had about finished putting on the
spare wheel. Hammond beckoned both officers into
the car and closed the door after him. A moment later
the motor started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell us about it, Commander,” the office man
urged, as they turned in to a more brightly lighted section
of the city. “You think the Lotus really took you
for Count Borg? If she didn’t, it’s going to make things
pretty difficult.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think you need to worry, Hammond,” Don
replied. “Remember, the light was very dim, so she
couldn’t have noticed small details. Of course, I had to
explain the loss of my moustache.... By the way, I’ve
got a dinner date with her for tomorrow evening at the
Empire!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ought to give us enough time to get fixed up
and coached for our parts,” Red Pennington commented.
“Gee, Don! What a lucky break! Our tire
blowin’ out, and Lotus showin’ up at the same time!
It all happened so naturally, not even the Scorpion himself
could suspect anything queer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless,” said Don thoughtfully, “the guard inside
Cho-San’s iron gate smelled something phony. You see,
Lotus <em>wanted</em> to believe I was Borg, but that other guy
may have been leery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A guard, huh?” snorted Hammond. “I don’t like
that, Commander! As you say, he just <em>might</em> have
smelled a mouse. Those Scorpion agents are suspecting
each other half the time, and.... Hmmmm! You
were close enough to see him plainly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only the glow of his cigarette tip,” answered Don.
“But why worry over that? Looks as if we’d arrived at
your office already; and I’m hungry enough to eat the
letters off a stone monument!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And those letters are sunk in, too!” laughed the Intelligence
man, reaching for the door handle. “Well,
Commander, there’s a hot meal waiting for you right
upstairs. I ordered it brought in, because you’re not
visiting any restaurant until your make-up is absolutely
perfect.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c010'>XX<br /> <br /><i>THE TEST</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was well past ten o’clock that morning before Don
and Red were roused from a four-hour nap in the local
Intelligence Office. After breakfast, they were fitted out
with clothes quickly tailored to fit, in preparation for
their new roles. Then, for several more hours they were
drilled, each man in his part, so as to make the disguise
as perfect as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow had already memorized all the real
Count Borg could teach him. Now, working from
photographs, and from a mass of information collected
by the office, other Intelligence operatives expertly polished
his likeness to the captured Scorpion aviator.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Red was made to study much harder for his
role of valet, since he had to start from scratch. At the
end of six hours’ unremitting work, he was pronounced
a “passable fake” and sent out to take rooms for his
master at the Hotel Empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somewhat later Don Winslow joined him. True to
the dressy habits of Count André Borg, he had to
change from the natty homespun business suit he was
wearing into formal “soup-and-fish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While he was adjusting his black bow tie, there came
a rap on the door. Red Pennington, now transformed
into the valet “Penny,” opened it with a flourish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please step inside, sir!” Don heard him say. “I
believe you are expected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excellent, Pennington! Excellent!” came Hammond’s
approving chuckle. “You’re getting more stiffnecked
and manservantish every minute. Shut that
door, now, and let’s have a few final words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir! Very good, sir!” chanted Red, looking
down his rather stubby nose. “But may I take your hat
and coat first, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grinning broadly, Hammond spun a chair away
from the wall and sat down on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lieutenant’s eaten his part like an old actor!”
he remarked. “But how about you, Commander? Do
you feel able to deceive the bright eyes of the fair Scorpion
spy who’ll be sitting across the table from you in
about ten minutes? They say a woman’s instinct is foolproof.
Of course, that may be all nonsense, but I’ve
seen some queer things happen in this Intelligence
game.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don finished buttoning his vest, and let Penny adjust
his Tuxedo jacket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Hammond,” he smiled, “I don’t feel nervous
about meeting Lotus’ inspection. That’s queer, too, because
it is probably the toughest test I’ll have to pass.
I’ve got a funny hunch about that young woman!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean—hunch?” growled Hammond,
with a piercing look. “You haven’t had time to learn
anything new about her. Listen, Commander! Just
because the kid is as attractive as they make ’em, you
musn’t go off the deep end. Keep your head, man, and
remember the lovelier she looks the more dangerous
she’s bound to be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s hearty laugh wiped some of the worry from
Hammond’s gloomy face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m certainly not going to fall in love with her, if
that’s what you mean!” he promised. “But seriously, I
<em>have</em> a hunch that if she found out who I really am,
she would be sport enough to give me a break. My
masquerade would be finished, but not necessarily my
life. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hammond got up from his chair, frowning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand, but I don’t agree,” he said heavily.
“The minute you come within speaking distance of a
Scorpion spy in that disguise, your life’s in danger. The
second you’re discovered, it’ll probably be curtains
whether pretty little Lotus or some squint-eyed thug
puts out your light. Well, I won’t be keeping you any
longer. Luck, Commander! And for the luvva Mike,
<em>watch your step</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red’s good-by warning was similar to Hammond’s,
but even more heartfelt. His right hand still half paralyzed
by the husky “Penny’s” grip, Don Winslow
walked quickly to the hotel elevator.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somewhat to his surprise, the operator greeted him
respectfully as “Count Borg” showing that the real
count was well known to the Empire staff. Don decided
that he would indeed have to “watch his step”!</p>

<p class='c009'>Lotus, he recalled, had mentioned a certain table in
a corner of the dining room, where she had met the
real count on past occasions. If she should not be there
waiting for him, Don would be in a fix. He could not
pick the wrong table to wait for <em>her</em>, without making
her suspicious.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he hesitated just outside the dining room, the
headwaiter spotted him and came forward quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Count Borg! It is good to have you with us
again after so long an absence!” the man murmured
with his most unctuous smile. “Is it perhaps that you
are expecting Mademoiselle Lotus this evening? If so,
your table in the corner is reserved for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a low bow, the headwaiter led the way to a
softly lighted alcove, somewhat apart from the main
dining room. It held one small table suitable for two
persons. The service included a single candle set in a
beautifully ornamented silver candlestick.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barely had the headwaiter pulled out Don’s chair,
when his alert eye caught a movement across the larger
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Eh, voilà, M’sieu le Comte!</em>” he exclaimed delightedly.
“Here is the so charming Mademoiselle already!
You will not have to wait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hurrying away, he was back in a moment, followed
by a dainty figure dressed in clinging white satin. Lotus
had made herself particularly charming this evening,
Don told himself. The pure simplicity of her low cut
gown, made her seem even younger than her actual
twenty years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slipping the expensive evening wrap from her
shoulders, she flicked it carelessly across the headwaiter’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come back in a few minutes, Maurice!” she said,
as the man bowed himself away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning to Don, she gave him a long, serious look.
Her eyes, Don thought, were like great wells of darkness.
As the seconds ticked past, and she did not speak,
he felt a tiny shiver of doubt. Was it possible, he wondered,
that the girl had already pierced his masquerade?</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once she came closer, with a low musical laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always mysterious, aren’t you, André?” she said,
taking both his hands. “Every time I meet you here, it
is the same! You stand looking at me so silent and
grave, until I feel like a silly little girl. But in the end
I always succeed in making you laugh and be silly with
me, don’t I, André?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With some difficulty Don held his serious pose. Lotus’
teasing laughter and girlish sweetness were harder to
resist than he had expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, child!” he said soberly, as he moved to
pull out her chair. “A strange thing has happened since
I last saw you. You <em>say</em> I am the same André. But it is
hardly the truth!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he sat down across the table he saw that the girl’s
cheeks had gone white as her dress. Her eyes, wide
with sudden alarm, seemed about to overflow with
tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t understand you!” she whispered faintly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant, Don found it hard to go on. This child
opposite him might be a Scorpion spy, even one of the
cleverest, but tonight she was simply a girl in love. A
very young girl, who had clearly laid her heart at the
feet of her hero, Count André Borg. And Don, the
pseudo André, was going to hurt her feelings cruelly.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a tough job, the young commander told himself,
but it had to be done. In the United States Navy’s
war against the warmakers, sometimes the innocent
had to suffer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bending forward, Don pushed away the sleek, dark
hair just above his temple, to show the neatly taped
head wound.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That happened during the attack on the Navy gunboat,
five days ago,” he said grimly. “A machine gun
bullet ripped through my seaplane and grooved my
skull. It was Don Winslow himself who pulled me out
of the water, after the plane cracked up—or so they tell
me. I woke up in the brig some hours later, too dazed
to know if I was afloat or ashore. Gradually my mind
cleared. <em>But my memory has been skipping cogs ever
since!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly the look of fright left Lotus’ face. Two large
tears trickled down each side of her pretty nose, but her
lips smiled tenderly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor André!” she cried, softly. “It must make
you feel queer—as if you were someone else—to have
your memory 'skip cogs’! But that is certain to cure
itself! After all your brain is not like the gears of a car
that have to be thrown away when they are broken.
You remember <em>me</em>! Very soon you will recall everything.
In the meantime, let Lotus be your memory,
dear André!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Don Winslow gazed into her eager, pleading little
face, he felt like kicking himself. Only the fact that
duty came before sentiment kept him from blurting out
the whole true story, then and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, child!” he said, glancing down at his
newly manicured fingernails. “I certainly hope you are
right about my mind clearing up in time; but right
now I am finding this loss of memory pretty awkward.
For instance, who is that large, Oriental person coming
toward us? He looks as if he knew me, all right, but I
can’t name him, for the life of me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San!” came Lotus’ gasp. “Why, André! You
don’t even remember ... my guardian? The greatest
power in all Scorpia, next to the master? Oh, this is
terrible! You must <em>pretend</em> to remember Cho-San,
whatever else you’ve forgotten, André!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c010'>XXI<br /> <br /><i>CHO-SAN</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>With a cool shrug of his shoulders, the pseudo count
returned to a study of his manicured fingers. He’d understood
from Hammond that there was little love lost
between dashing André Borg and the saturnine Chinese,
Cho-San. If that were true, a pose of insulting
indifference would be the safest.</p>

<p class='c009'>In any case, it seemed to be working now. As Don
continued to ignore his presence, the big Oriental stood
glowering beside the table. Like a huge frog, he seemed
to swell with silent rage. Suddenly he beckoned the
anxiously hovering headwaiter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another chair, Maurice!” he growled in a heavy
bass. “Mademoiselle Lotus seems to be in the company
of an idiot. I shall stay to protect her, in case he becomes
a worse nuisance. Bring me a chair, quickly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Maurice hurried to obey, Lotus half arose, her
hands clasping and unclasping in distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Cho-San!” she choked. “Be patient with
André—Count Borg, I mean! Five days ago he received
a wound on the head, while carrying out your orders.
Since then his mind has not been the same....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evidently not!” grated the Chinese, seating himself
in the chair Maurice had brought. “No man in his
right mind deliberately insults Cho-San, though your
André has come very near to doing so in times past.
Well, Borg, have you lost your tongue as well as your
reason? You had it at three o’clock this morning when
you made this appointment with my ward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So your watchman overheard and told you about
that, Cho-San!” drawled the pretended Borg, as Maurice
glided away. “I thought he would, but I’m surprised
you were interested enough to follow Lotus and me
here. Er—by the way, it’s quite true about that head
wound I got. My memory has blanked out. It’s only
now and then I recall something that’s happened in
the past few years. Of course, I know you and Lotus,
here; but how and why and where you came into my
life I haven’t the faintest idea! Awful nuisance, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For sixty long seconds, Cho-San stared at “Count
Borg’s” handsome, rather bored features. His sloe-black
eyes were so wickedly penetrating that Don was glad
his disguise didn’t depend on paint or false hair. Even
the tiny scar below his eye was genuine. For the rest,
Don hoped that he had copied Count Borg’s own voice
and manner successfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last Cho-San’s big body relaxed its angry tenseness.
When he spoke, his voice had taken on a smoother
inflection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would give a great deal to know just <em>what</em> has
changed about you, my dear Count,” he remarked. “It
may be your mind—in another sense of the word—for
certainly you have never dared to insult me publicly
before. Your alleged loss of memory is all poppy-cock,
of course. It may take time to discover what your new
game is, but I shall do it. Meantime, you will take my
orders as before, if you know what is good for you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow permitted a lazy smile to grow at the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh—ah—of course, Cho-San!” he murmured, covering
a yawn. “And really, it doesn’t make much difference
whether you believe my memory’s gone or not,
so long as <em>I</em> know it has. But let’s stop talking about
orders and insults and call Maurice back. Lotus will be
much more interested in a lobster a la Newburg I am
certain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cho-San agreed with a surly grunt, and the three
orders were taken. During the meal “Count Borg” told
the story he had rehearsed about his capture and subsequent
escape from Haiti in Michael Splendor’s plane.
He made it brief but convincing, even naming the spot
where he had abandoned the plane sixteen hours before.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he talked he was aware that both the girl and her
grim-faced guardian were studying him closely. What
thoughts were passing through their minds, he scarcely
dared to guess. Certainly Cho-San’s moonlike pokerface
betrayed even less than his grunted comments. Lotus,
for some reason, appeared too upset for speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don was glad when the uncomfortable meal was
over, and Cho-San made the first motion to leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry to interrupt your evening <em>tête-à-tête</em>, my
dear Count Borg,” the Oriental said with oily sarcasm,
“but your presence is required at the comrades’ headquarters.
Immediately, do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With an indifferent smile, Don moved to pick up
Lotus’ evening wrap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you my memory, not my understanding, had
done a blackout, Cho-San,” he drawled. “Lead the way,
old dear, and I’ll follow. Only first, I’ll send upstairs for
my medicine.... Er—Maurice! Will you phone up for
my valet to bring it down now with my hat and topcoat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Medicine! Valet!” snarled the big Chinese, glaring
furiously at Don. “What new stall is this, Borg? I tell
you, I’m in no mood for trifling tonight! A man in
your youth and health needing medicine—bah! And
who is this manservant you’ve picked up? Haven’t I
warned you....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s my wound, you know,” cut in the pseudo count.
“Ever since that bullet nicked me, I’ve had the most
frightful headaches. Actually blind me at times! So this
morning I asked a druggist chap for something, and he
prescribed....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the devil with your druggist—and with you, too,
Borg!” spat the Scorpion leader. “You may think you’re
funny, but I do not. Lotus! Bring this fool out to the
door in three minutes, or it will be the worse for you
both. I’ll wait for you just that long!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning on his heel, the bulky Oriental stalked out
of the alcove. Following slowly with Lotus, Don saw
Cho-San halt and stare at the figure of “Penny” who
had just appeared in the lobby. Evidently Red had
made record time for a valet, after getting the head-waiter’s
phone call.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a murmured excuse to Lotus, Don stepped forward
to meet his manservant at a point just out of earshot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, Red!” he whispered, taking the small bottle
Pennington had brought. “I’m going for a ride with
Cho-San and the Lotus in about two minutes. Follow
us in another car, but watch your step. That’s all for
now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slipping into his topcoat, he sauntered back to the
girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, little Lotus!” he said banteringly. “We
musn’t keep your guardian waiting. It’s bad for the
jolly old dragon’s disposition. By the way, where are
the comrades’ headquarters he spoke of. I suppose I
must have been there countless times, but it’s all foggy
in my head now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sudden fear showed again in the look Lotus gave
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I wonder, André,” she said in a strained tone, “if
Cho-San may not be partly right about the change in
you. It doesn’t seem possible you could have forgotten
so many things! I wonder if you are not just playing
a part, for some strange purpose of your own!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no time for Don to think up a reply, as
they were already passing through the outer door. Just
across the sidewalk the huge figure of Cho-San bulked
beside a waiting car.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once inside the limousine, Don found himself in no
mood for further self-explanations. More and more it
was being impressed upon him that the job he had
undertaken was beset with risks. So far he had been
able to dodge open failure; but this fact failed to set
his mind at ease.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cho-San, and now Lotus herself, had made it plain
that they suspected something wrong with him other
than a loss of memory. They seemed to take it for
granted that he was really Count André Borg, yet they
accused him of playing a part!</p>

<p class='c009'>Don would have given his right hand now to know
just what suspicions were seething in the minds of his
two companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another question popped up to startle him, as the
big car rolled through San Francisco’s older, dimly
lighted section.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Did the real Count Borg know the Chinese language?</em></p>

<p class='c009'>As if in answer to his thought, Cho-San spoke suddenly
in rapid, sing-song syllables.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Kia hing—po pay-ow ni shi lee ting!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s scalp prickled as if a gun had been leveled at
his head. Was this the showdown he asked himself?</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>So-lay-ow!</em>” came the chanted response from the
driver’s seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s lungs deflated in a sigh of relief. The Chinese
syllables were not meant for him. He had the feeling
of having stepped over another deadly trap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Don Winslow is still in Haiti?” rumbled the
Scorpion leader’s next words. “Did you learn, my dear
Count, anything about his further plans while you were
there? For instance, does he intend to return shortly
to the United States?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t hear a thing about his intentions, Cho-San,”
replied Don indifferently. “I fancy, though, that he’ll
be in the plane Michael Splendor is flying here today.
Splendor’s a bit sore, you know, about my stealing his
big cabin job. He broadcast the news that he was flying
here on a hunch that I’d head for 'Frisco. Maybe
his pilot will be this Winslow chap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ummmm, I wonder!” mumbled the Oriental. “They
say he looks enough like you, Borg, to be your twin. In
a certain situation you might even impersonate him.
Suppose, for instance, that Winslow should disappear
without his friends being the wiser—just what would
prevent your taking his place in the interests of Scorpia?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s answer was a laugh that he tried to make natural.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my dear Cho-San,” he retorted, “the interests
of Scorpia would prevent my doing that to take the
words out of your mouth! I admit I look like Winslow,
but his voice, his walk, and everything else about him
is different; so don’t talk nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San <em>never</em> talks nonsense, you fool!” hissed the
Chinese. “You will do well to remember that your life
depends on your usefulness to Scorpia, and to me—its
mouthpiece! If you don’t, the next time a bullet strikes
your skull it may be better aimed!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c010'>XXII<br /> <br /><i>WET TRACKS IN THE FOG</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The big car twisted and turned through the narrow
streets, boring deeper into the dark heart of old Chinatown.
Don Winslow, seated between Cho-San and
Lotus, felt his sense of danger rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>At any moment now, the Chinese chauffeur would
pull up at an unfamiliar building. Then, flanked by
two Scorpion spies, the pretended Count Borg would
enter the underworld of Scorpia.</p>

<p class='c009'>What further tests would he have to pass Don could
not guess. He knew only that if he failed his life would
pay the forfeit!</p>

<p class='c009'>Tensely he told himself that he must not fail. For the
honor of the United States Navy, for the sake of his
friends, and of all who prefer peace to war’s mass
murder, <em>he must not fail</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>Glancing at Cho-San, he saw that the Scorpion leader
was studying a small pocket mirror, cupped in one of
his huge hands. The mirror was held so as to reflect
everything that could be seen through the car’s rear
window.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly with an angry snort, the big Chinese bent
forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Yi kow pu hau-tung sai-kai!</em>” he cried sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ta hau</em>,” came the driver’s answering sing-song,
“<em>kia hing</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a jerk the car speeded up, throwing the passengers
back against the cushions. Don felt Lotus’ small,
cool hand close down on his finger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s that car following us, André,” she explained.
“Cho-San has just told Ko Loo, the chauffeur, to speed
up and lose it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don twisted to look through the rear window at the
criss-crossing traffic of an intersection. With a short
laugh he turned back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San knows best,” he remarked lightly. “I
couldn’t tell if one of those pairs of lights back there
were following us. It looks to me as if they all are. But
what’s the difference?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“None, my dear Borg,” rumbled Cho-San, “considering
that Ko Loo has never yet failed to put an enemy
off the trail. As a matter of fact, two sets of lights are
following us at this moment. The trailer is being trailed
by one of our own cars. He will have an unpleasant
surprise, in addition to losing track of us!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sharp anxiety shot through Don’s mind. “An unpleasant
surprise” might mean anything from a car accident
to murder. And Red Pennington was the trailer
who was going to get it!</p>

<p class='c009'>However, there was nothing in the world that Don
could do to warn his friend. By this time both cars
were out of sight. Ko Loo skidded the big limousine
around two more dim corners at twenty miles an hour,
and pulled up abruptly in front of a dark warehouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ki-wo-pu teh shwoh!</em>” sang out Cho-San’s commanding
bass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Ta chang!</em>” came the answer, as Ko Loo sprang out
to obey the order. In the foggy night the chauffeur’s
voice had a curious, muffled sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost immediately he returned, and the car rolled
silently forward into a black, cavelike opening. As it
stopped, Lotus again squeezed Don’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Last time, we came another way—remember, André?”
she whispered. “We are now in the garage next
to Cho-San’s curio shop. Of course it doesn’t look like
a garage from the outside with the doors closed....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Yi ko pu hau!</em> I shall not need you any more, Ko
Loo,” interrupted Cho-San harshly. “Get out; Lotus. I’ll
follow you, Count Borg. Since your mind is admittedly
sick, I would rather not turn my back on you, even
here in my own quarters!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tit for tat, and insult for insult!” smiled Don, as a
brilliant light filled the room from concealed electric
lamps. “You can’t make me angry tonight, though,
Cho-San. Not even by breaking up my evening’s date
with your ward! So far, your little game of hide-and-seek
is most fascinating. Even as a boy, I remember....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite so!” hissed the Chinese furiously. “There is
nothing wrong with your memory, Borg! And I can
promise that you will have cause to remember <em>this</em>
night if you live to be a hundred—which is not likely.
Ummm-hummm! Not likely at all! Now, Lotus, if you
will lead the way, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which—which way do you wish to take, Cho-San?”
asked the girl in a frightened voice. “The one through
the shop?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ummmm, yes. That will do,” rumbled the Oriental.
“It will be new, I think, to Count Borg.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right-o!” agreed Don airily. “I don’t remember
any secret passage through your shop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You made the last trip to the comrades’ quarters by
way of Cho-San’s house, André,” Lotus murmured,
taking Don’s hand. “Follow me closely now, and don’t
put out your hand to touch the walls!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she spoke a panel slid noiselessly open in the side
of the room. Cho-San raised his hand to the light
switch. Glancing back Don noted with surprise that the
big rolling doors of the garage were now shut, though
no sound had betrayed their closing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Darkness descended like a blow as he turned his
head. Don could not hear Cho-San’s footsteps, though
he guessed that the Chinese was moving toward him.
Lotus’ gentle grasp on his hand was the only thing that
seemed real in that Stygian blackness. Like a blind man
he followed her lead.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>Meantime, several blocks away, Red Pennington
perched anxiously on the seat of a skidding taxi. The
driver he had picked up outside the Empire Hotel was
good at this game of trailing a car on the dodge, but
Ko Loo had been giving him the works.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both the driver and his fare realized this at the same
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s this blasted fog, sir!” the former complained,
straightening out after a turn on two wheels. “I can’t
get close enough to see if that car ahead’s the same one
we’re after. Not without rammin’ his rear bumper!
Seems to me that guy cut in from behind us while we
was dodgin’ cross-traffic a mile back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got the same idea, so you must be right,” groaned
Red, peering through the misted glass. “Look! That
car’s stopping—pulling over to the curb. Suppose you
pull in ahead of it. I just saw something else....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yeah? Well, all right!” grunted the driver, jamming
on his brakes. “That car we just passed ain’t the one
we was chasin’ first, so what’s the diff? The meter reads
ten miles an’ a quarter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take that and keep the change, brother!” replied
Red, shoving a bill with two figures on it into the taxi
driver’s hand. “I’m getting out here. Stick around for a
few minutes, in case I need you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not waiting for the man’s thanks, he dodged across
the misty street. Some two hundred feet back, the glare
of the taxi’s headlights had briefly picked out a gilt
sign on a darkened shop front. The words Red had
glimpsed were: “CHO-SAN’S <em>Antiques and Curios</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, whipping a small flashlight from his pocket,
he read the sign again, from the distance of a few feet.
The shop, whose window was curtained, seemed neither
large nor pretentious. On either side were warehouses
closed by high, sliding doors. The blank, uninteresting
walls were in need of paint and spotted with torn bill
posters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some dump!” Red Pennington muttered to himself.
“Well, I had to take a look at what was under that
sign, even if it didn’t do me a whale of a lot of good!
We lost Don’s car so far back that there’s no use guessing
where it—Huh! THAT’S something I didn’t see
before!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The flashlight beam, pointing downward, had picked
out the marks of wet tire treads crossing the sidewalk
at his feet The tracks disappeared under the big rolling
doors of the warehouse to the left of Cho-San’s shop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometime in the past hour, perhaps in the last few
minutes, a car had gone in there!</p>

<p class='c009'>As Red stood there pondering, he heard a motor
start up behind him. At the moment, however, it did
not seem important. The real problem was to find proof
that the car which had made those wet tracks was the
one he’d been trying to follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bending down, he scrutinized the tread marks by the
light of his small pocket torch. The sidewalk all about
them was covered with tiny droplets of moisture, he
noticed. But the marks themselves were barely starting
to mist over.</p>

<p class='c009'>Acting on a sudden idea, Red threw his light on one
of his own footprints made on the fog-wet sidewalk a
few seconds before. Already, he saw, two or three droplets
had formed on the darker spot where his heel had
pressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conclusion was plain. A big car, with new, expensive
tires had entered the warehouse doors <em>less than
five minutes ago</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>As Red Pennington straightened up, he made his
decision. He would take the taxi back to the nearest
public telephone, call Hammond at the office, report
what he had found, and then stick around on watch
until relieved by a trained detective. Longer watching
might attract attention, considering that he had come
out minus hat or topcoat.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few quick steps took him across the street to the
car which was waiting at the curb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Okay, brother!” he said, jerking open the rear door
and ducking inside. “Back to the nearest phone booth,
and make it snappy! There’s another ten spot in it for
you if—Say! What tha ding-dong.... <em>This isn’t my
taxi!”</em></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c010'>XXIII<br /> <br /><i>THE CHINESE CABINET</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At the end of fifty steps in a darkness so thick that
it could almost be felt, Lotus pressed Don’s hand, signaling
a halt. As she did so, there sounded the soft
whir of hidden machinery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We arrive at the gateway of a secret world, my dear
Count!” boomed Cho-San’s bass voice from somewhere
behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man’s voice echoed strangely as if thrown back
by the arches of the unseen tunnel. For all his effort
at self-control, Don Winslow felt a shiver of apprehension
creep up his spine at the eerie sound of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve never had a fancy for this underground stuff,
Cho-San,” he answered, forcing a laugh. “It’s not in an
airman’s line, you know. Give me the freedom of the
sky, every time, and you can have your underground
ratholes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, André!” cried Lotus softly, clinging to his
arm. “Scorpia must operate not only in the air, not only
on sea and land, but <em>underneath</em> them as well. You
know that as well as anybody. See, now! The panel is
opening, and we step through into Cho-San’s shop,
where you have been many times.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they emerged into the dimly lighted curio shop,
the soft whir of machinery ended with a click.</p>

<p class='c009'>Glancing over his shoulder, Don saw the big Chinese
standing behind him against a blank wall. There was
no sign of the opening through which the three of
them had just passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neat, very neat indeed, Cho-San!” murmured the
pseudo count. “But, tell me, which way do we go from
here to the comrades’ quarters? My recollection is still
a bit vague, although this room does seem familiar....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cabinet!” broke in the Scorpion leader shortly.
“That way is the quickest. And I am tired of hearing
about your infernal memory, Borg! Open the cabinet,
Lotus!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Obediently the girl crossed to a huge cabinet of ebony
wood, and twisted one of its curiously carved dragons’
heads. With scarcely a sound the door swung wide,
leaving an opening the size of a full grown man. How
far back the space extended Don could not see from
where he stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Step in, Lotus, and show your André the way!”
sneered Cho-San. “You act, Count Borg, as if it were a
trap. Don’t worry, I am following you both inside!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chinese suited his action to the word, closing
the cabinet door after him. Again Don caught the
smooth, scarcely audible hum of oiled machinery somewhere
near by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More darkness!” he sighed after a number of seconds
had ticked by in silence. “Really, Cho-San, a nice
bright electric bulb here would cheer things up! By the
way, I thought we were going somewhere in a hurry.
This jolly old cabinet....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence, fool!” gritted the Oriental. “You are no
longer in the cabinet you entered a moment ago. That
ancient work of art is now standing as you saw it, far
above us. Only its floor is missing, for that is now beneath
our feet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here we are almost at the entrance to the comrades’
quarters!” cried Lotus, as the elevator floor quivered briefly.
“Now I shall press another invisible button,
and you shall see that I am right, André. There will be
plenty of light where we are going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more a panel slid aside to show a narrow, dimly
lighted corridor. This one seemed to be dug out of bedrock,
with rough corners projecting. Slipping into it,
the girl disappeared around a jagged corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll get hurt dodging around those rocks!” Don
exclaimed. “Where’s she gone, anyway? Why didn’t
you stop her, Cho-San?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because she is in no danger—as yet!” purred the big
Chinese. “The little Lotus has been brought up in these
subterranean passages and rooms. She knows her way
where you, my dear count, would lose yours a hundred
times over. Just now she has gone to turn up more
lights so that you can see to follow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke, the rough passage was flooded with sudden
brilliance, far greater than necessary, Don thought.
As he stepped away from the elevator toward Lotus’
waiting figure, Cho-San himself volunteered the explanation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are machine guns covering every turn on this
passage, Borg,” he chortled evilly. “You cannot see
them, so you must take my word. Under these brilliant
lights they could mow down any police forces which
might be unlucky enough to come this far into Scorpia’s
underworld, or anyone trying to escape from it. A very
comforting thought, don’t you agree?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s only answer was a shrug of his smoothly tailored
shoulders. The next moment he was at Lotus’
side picking his way over the tunnel’s uneven floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Around the second turn the girl halted, and reaching
up, inserted her fingers behind an angle of the damp
stone. As if by magic a door-sized section of the rock
wall moved back, disclosing a furnished apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don stepped through the opening, closely followed
by Cho-San. At the soft click of a falling latch, he did
not even bother to turn. The wall through which they
had just passed would show no sign of a doorway, he
was certain.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time since leaving the car in the garage,
the Chinese now seemed to drop his air of ugly suspicion.
His moonlike face was almost smiling as he
turned to face Don.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will leave you, my friend, for a short while,” his
deep voice intoned. “The little Lotus will remain to
entertain you, so that the time will not pass too heavily.
If there is anything more you may desire before I return,
simply touch that bell by the table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a parting nod his huge figure vanished behind
a tall, carved screen. Don Winslow stood gazing at it
thoughtfully for a long moment, then turned to his
small companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, little Lotus,” he began, “I hope your memory
never starts playing tricks on you like mine. This room,
for instance—”</p>

<p class='c009'>A strange expression in the girl’s dark eyes stopped
him short. Following her look and gesture he stepped
quickly to the inlaid teakwood table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thing looked innocent enough. It’s decorated top
bore nothing but a vase and a small lacquered tray. One
glance underneath, however, explained Lotus’ silent
warning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fastened to the underside of the table top was a compact
little dictaphone, no doubt being used at this moment
by a Scorpion eavesdropper!</p>

<p class='c009'>Back at the spot where he had first stood, Don picked
up the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This apartment <em>does</em> seem vaguely familiar,” he
continued. “It’s like something I dreamed about long
ago. Perhaps if you showed me the other rooms it
might all come back to me. Shall we try it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the cue for which the girl had been waiting.
With an eager nod she led the way toward a curtained
archway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, certainly, André!” she answered. “There’s no
harm in looking around. These are the comrades’
quarters, or at least one section of them, and of course
you have been here before. Beyond this hall is a small
dining room, and a sort of butler’s pantry. The sleeping
quarters are on another level entirely....”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the heavy curtains fell back into place, Don found
himself in a tiny hallway, lighted by a dim overhead
lamp. He was about to proceed when the girl’s quick
grasp on his arm halted him in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can talk now,” she whispered, “but we must be
brief. <em>I know who you are, Don Winslow!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shock of those words paralyzed Don’s wits for
the space of five heartbeats. Backing off, he reached for
the small but deadly automatic pistol concealed under
his left armpit. An instant later he dropped his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am at your mercy, it appears!” he said with a
twisted smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl shook her dark head. Gliding closer she
lifted her eyes to stare straight into his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Cho-San, not Lotus, whom you have cause to
fear,” she said. “He believes you are working against
Scorpia for your own interests, but he does not know
the truth. I shall not tell him, Don Winslow, provided
you have done no harm to Count André Borg!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don thought that over carefully. He read the meaning
behind her words, and knew Lotus was in love
with the dashing André. Besides she must be aware
that Borg’s advertised escape was a mere blind. Why,
then, did she not take revenge, for herself and her
friends, by showing up the pseudo count without
delay?</p>

<p class='c009'>Puzzled, he put a question of his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I tell you that Count Borg is safe and well, except
for a head wound like mine, how can you trust my
word? A man in danger of his life is apt to say
anything which will save it. How do you know I won’t lie
to you, Miss Lotus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will not lie, for the simple reason that I am
ready to believe your word,” the girl answered confidently.
“That way, I put myself at <em>your</em> mercy. I trust
myself to your honor, which you would rather die than
betray. Is it not so, Don Winslow of the Navy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a silent laugh Don threw up his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You win, Miss Lotus!” he admitted. “The truth is
that Count André Borg is well and will come to no
harm, in spite of any past crimes he may have committed.
It is a long story, but ...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop!” cried Lotus, fiercely gripping the young officer’s
jacket front. “You say he is well, yet he will not
be punished! Do you mean his <em>mind</em> has been injured?
That wound on his head ... No! No! I would rather
have André dead than insane! Tell me! Tell me the
whole truth, or I <em>will</em> call Cho-San!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly Don gave her an outline of Count Borg’s
strange situation, from the moment when he came to
his senses in the <em>Gatoon’s</em> sick bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, Miss Lotus,” the young commander explained,
“your friend is a lot saner now than he was
during the seven years he served Scorpia. It is fortunate
for him that he doesn’t recall anything of that time.
To him, April, nineteen thirty-three, seems only last
week!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl’s eyes had filled with tears that suddenly
overflowed. Her small mouth quivered like a lost
child’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then—then he isn’t my André any more!” she
sobbed softly. “He doesn’t remember that he ever knew
me. Now I have nothing left to live for—not even one
true friend!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c010'>XXIV<br /> <br /><i>CHO-SAN’S NEWS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A drooping, discouraged little figure, Lotus stumbled
back to the closed curtains. As she raised a hand to part
them, Don Winslow called her back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are wrong,” he said huskily as the girl turned.
“Count Borg needs friends right now. He needs you,
Lotus! One of these days he will be released. If he has
no friend to whom it matters, <em>he’s</em> going to feel life and
liberty aren’t worth much, isn’t he? Answer me that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly Lotus’ small chin lifted. Her shoulders lost
their discouraged droop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Don Winslow!” she whispered. “André
was like that, too, saying things to give me courage
when all seemed hopeless. You resemble each other in
more things than voice and appearance. That is why I
couldn’t ever betray you to Cho-San! But come! It is
dangerous to talk here longer. We must return to the
living room, in case Cho-San comes looking for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don realized that she was right. Without a word he
followed back through the curtained archway, ready
once more to play the part of Count Borg. As it turned
out, they were barely in time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lotus had just seated herself when the little French
maid, Suzette, appeared silently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A telephone message for Mademoiselle!” the girl
announced. “Cho-San requests that you take it from
the apartment of Doctor Skell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a warning glance at Don, Lotus rose to her feet.
“You will excuse me, André?” she asked. “It seems
that our evening together is doomed to be broken up ... Suzette!
Are you not glad to see Count Borg after
his three months’ absence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The maid bobbed a quaint little foreign courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am ver’ glad to see you again, Monsieur!” she
smiled, as Lotus left the room. “Did Mademoiselle have
time to show you through the new apartment beyond
this one? It has been made over since you were last
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wink which accompanied the last statement set
Don’s thoughts racing. Suzette’s hint was plain enough.
She wanted an excuse to lead him out of the room.
But why? Did she have something to say that was not
meant for the hidden dictaphone?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Made over, hmmm?” Don drawled, picking up the
cue where she dropped it. “No, Mademoiselle didn’t
show me that. Might as well kill time while she’s gone
by taking a look.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rising, he followed the little maid through the same
archway where Lotus had taken him. As the heavy curtains
fell back in place, he was not surprised to find
Suzette at his elbow. Standing on tiptoe, the French
maid whispered swiftly in his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I also,” he caught the softly breathed words, “know
who you are, Commander!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shock to Don’s nerves was less, this time; but
before he had time to recover, Suzette pulled his ear
down once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must be brief, M’sieur,” she murmured, “but I
will tell you that w’ich even Mademoiselle Lotus do
not know. I am operative of the French Secret Service,
working to discover the Scorpion’s so evil plans. I listen
w’en you talk with Mademoiselle behind this curtain.
Of course I have hear of the so famous Don Winslow,
so I tell myself: 'Suzette, you are one lucky woman!
Perhaps you can help the Commander to trap the enemy
tonight!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>In silent admiration, Don offered the plucky girl his
hand. How long she had been risking her life surrounded
day and night by Scorpion agents, he could
only guess. Both her cleverness and her courage, he
knew, must be extraordinary to get away with such a
feat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean we can find a way to trap them at the big
meeting tonight?” he whispered breathlessly. “That’s
even a bigger stunt than I’d hoped to pull off! I came
here to get evidence against the big shots, but if we can
deal Scorpia a crippling blow at the same time....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Oui!</em> That is my thought!” cut in the French woman
swiftly. “But there is not now time to tell you my
plan. Instead I must warn you. Something have happen
to make Cho-San suspect you are not André Borg!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That cuts it!” groaned Don. “I must have been pulling
a whole string of boners. First Lotus, then you, and
now Cho-San gets wise to me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No! It is not that, M’sieur!” whispered the little
maid. “You have not pull the boner, and Cho-San is
not sure. You see he have just got the news that Michael
Splendor and Commander Winslow have arrived by
plane. The Scorpion spy who saw them at the airport
say Don Winslow have a wound on the head jus’ like
yours. That start Cho-San wondering w’ich is the real
Don Winslow and w’ich is Count André Borg.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so,” smiled Don grimly, “Cho-San sent you in
to size me up and report which of the two <em>you</em> think
I am! Well, so long as he isn’t sure, I stand a chance
to get away with it. I’ll have to be more than ever on
my guard now, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mais oui!</em>” Suzette said loudly, pushing aside the
curtains. “And now, Monsieur, that you have seen the
made over apartment, is there anything else you desire?
Perhaps some music from the radio, while you await
Mademoiselle Lotus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Don could reply, Cho-San himself appeared
from behind the tall screen. A wave of his long fingered
hand disposed of the maid. As she glided from the
room, the big Chinese turned slowly to face the young
Intelligence officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have news for you. Count Borg,” he announced in
an ominous tone. “The man who is your double in
voice and features has just arrived at the airport. My
agent who saw him reported that the wound on his
head is identical with yours. But that is not all. It seems
that even the tiny scar beneath Count Borg’s cheekbone
has reproduced itself on the face of Don Winslow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long moment Don’s gray eyes returned the
Oriental’s snakelike gaze. Above all things, he told himself,
he must not show nervousness. Instead, he managed
an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, really, Cho-San,” he bantered. “You can’t expect
me to swallow a whopper like that! Either you’re
pulling my leg, or your agent had one glass too many
under his belt when he looked at Winslow. The Commander
wouldn’t have any reason to copy my facial
misfortunes, you know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know!” snarled Cho-San, giving way to
one of his sudden rages. “I have found Commander
Winslow unbelievably clever on many occasions. If I
thought he could lower his stiff pride to impersonate
a fool, I should suspect that <em>your</em> scars were faked!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that the real Count Borg is now a traitor wearing
the uniform of a United States Navy Commander?”
crowed Don, sinking limply onto the nearest couch.
“Oh-h-n, ha-ha-ha! I never thought to see you so confused,
Cho-San! Why, supposing Winslow were—ha,
ha—such an idiot as to shoot himself in the head, he
couldn’t fake this scar under my eye, too. You can see
for yourself, Cho-San. It isn’t painted!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lurching to his feet, Don thrust his face close to that
of the glowering Chinese. The effect was everything
that he desired. On the instant, Cho-San’s suspicion
was swept away by the sheer violence of his wrath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence, you laughing hyena!” thundered the Scorpion
leader. “Perhaps if your silly face <em>were</em> painted it
would sicken me less! As it is, I shall use it to serve
the purposes of Scorpia, in a way suggested by Don
Winslow himself. Within the next twenty-four hours
that young officer will disappear. At the same time you,
André Borg, will take his place and carry out certain
orders. With Winslow safely in our hands, we shall
proceed to spread dismay in the ranks of the Navy
Intelligence!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The harsh brutality in Cho-San’s voice did more than
anything to reassure Don. The Chinese had evidently
made up his mind that Count Borg now stood before
him, and had turned his explosive energy to another
problem. From now on Don’s best play was obviously
to agree.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he was about to reply, a concealed buzzer
sounded loudly in the room. Cho-San turned with a
muttered exclamation, and hurried out by way of the
carved screen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c010'>XXV<br /> <br /><i>LOTUS’ CONFESSION</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Puzzled and impatient, Don Winslow paced up and
down the large, luxuriously furnished room. He liked
to plan his moves in advance. Instead, ever since he
had met Lotus in the dining room of the Empire, he
had been facing one unexpected situation after another,
in bewildering succession.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether Suzette, the French Secret Service operative,
had any definite plans he could not tell. As for Lotus,
he wanted another talk with her out of range from any
concealed dictaphone.</p>

<p class='c009'>A soft <em>click</em> of a latch behind caused him to whirl.
There stood the girl herself, laughing, her back against
the innocent-looking panel through which she must
have entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, please!” she cried, coming swiftly
toward him. “But your expression was so funny—as if I
had stuck a pin into you. These hidden panels and
underground corridors make you nervous, don’t they,
Commander?”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Don’s warning, “Sh-h-h!” Lotus shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all right, if we speak very low,” she reassured
him. “I disconnected the dictaphone at the other end.
Besides, there’s no one trying to listen now. Cho-San
has other fish to fry just at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” Don asked quickly. “A moment before
you came in a buzzer sounded and he acted as if
it were a fire alarm!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a sort of alarm,” the girl replied, seating herself
in one of the deep arm chairs. “Dr. Skell got a
telephone message from the garage. It seems that two
of our city agents caught someone snooping about the
place, and wanted to know what to do with him. Not
that it matters much, but Cho-San will probably want
to look him over.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>It mattered a great deal to Red Pennington, however,
that he had let himself be caught by such a simple trick.
As he sat now in the back of a strange car, under
the muzzle of a thug’s pistol he understood only too
well what had happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>His captors, doubtless in the employ of Scorpia, had
simply threatened or bribed his own taxi driver to
clear out. The two cars looked much alike in the dark,
and Red had been too unsuspecting to notice the difference,
until a gun poked him in the face. As he sat there
fuming at his own stupidity, the second plug-ugly came
back from across the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I phoned de house an’ asked wot ta do wid him,”
the fellow reported. “De guy I talked to said ta leave
him in de garage tied up, and turn off de lights.”
“Okay!” grunted the second mobster. “I guess the
big shots wanna give him the once-over. If he’s one of
them Navy Intelligence ducks they’ll prob’ly bump him
off, or burn him in their Chinese torture room. Anyhow,
it ain’t none of our business.... Come on, you
punk! Git out an’ put your hands behind you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The last words were addressed to Red, and emphasized
by a wicked jab of the pistol barrel that raised a
welt along the young officer’s jaw. Pretending to be
frightened speechless. Red obeyed, but his brain was
working at top speed to figure out a break.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the first touch of the gangster’s rope, Red’s crossed
wrists flew apart. Sweeping up, his hands caught his
enemy by the head. With a powerful forward heave
he hurled the thug’s body over his shoulder, then
whirled to grapple the second man.</p>

<p class='c009'>A pistol barked, its bullet grazing Red’s arm. The
next instant he had wrenched the weapon away by a
swift jiu-jitsu trick, sending its owner reeling with a
right hook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we’ll see who’s runnin’ this party!” he growled.
“Hands up or I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c009'>WHAP!</p>

<p class='c009'>A blackjack wielded by the first mobster slapped
Red’s unprotected head. The bulky officer collapsed
without a groan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tha fat spy! I hope ya killed him!” rasped the man
whose jaw Red had cracked. “He made my teeth ache
right down to my heels!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shut up and grab hold of his legs, Gimpy!” the
other retorted. “If I did kill him, we got an alibi. He
was threatenin’ us with your gun! Anyway, we’ll shove
him in the garage and let the big shots worry about
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To carry Red’s limp body across to the warehouse
and through a small door at one side was a short job.
A second telephone call completed the business. Immediately
the pair of mobsters drove away, the bigger
one still groaning about his sore jaw.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, in the living room of the comrades’
quarters, Don Winslow was getting the real story of
the beautiful Scorpion spy, Lotus. The girl had thrown
away all pretense. She said she hated Scorpia and its
evil plots to stir up war among the nations.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for her own part in it, ever since she had been old
enough to know right from wrong, her girlish instincts
had rebelled against a life of spying and deceit. Yet
her fear of Cho-San, and especially of that mysterious
personage who called himself the Scorpion, had forced
her to obey their orders. Even if she had dared to break
with their dreaded organization, she had nowhere to
go, no one to protect her from the vengeance of Scorpia.</p>

<p class='c009'>At least, Lotus intimated, that was the situation until
she had met Count Borg. André was not the criminal
type she had known. He never spoke of his past life,
even after she came to know him well, but he had
evidently been a man of honor and high culture until
joining the ranks of Scorpia.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lonely girl had fallen desperately in love with
him, though he had never acted as anything more than
a kind friend to her. Whenever she whispered to him
her longing to be free from Scorpia, André would
show only a passing interest. Once he had half promised
to take her away from Cho-San’s jealous guardianship,
but it never came to anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now that André is no longer one of Scorpia,
he has forgotten me!” Lotus finished tearfully. “Now
I will never be free, for there is no one who will help
me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” exclaimed Don gruffly, trying to hide
the feelings her story had roused in him. “Listen, Miss
Lotus! You have a lot more real friends than you ever
had before. I’m one of them, and I know of another
right here in this underground stronghold of Scorpia.
When you get clear, there’ll be others—Uncle Sam’s
trusted officers and agents, men and women—who’ll
stand ready to protect you until we’ve wiped the
Scorpion and Cho-San off the slate. You’ll pick up your
friendship with Count Borg on better terms than before.
He’ll be needing <em>you</em> this time, Miss Lotus—needing
someone who really cares!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don Winslow,” answered the girl solemnly, “you’ve
given me a hope to live for. That’s something so priceless,
something so far beyond any thanks, that I won’t
try to say more. Except that you’re going to stop calling
me <em>Miss</em>. Promise me that, Commander!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plain Don, to you!” amended the young officer,
gripping the strong little hand she offered him. “All
right, Lotus; we’re shipmates from now on. In the
name of the United States Navy, I welcome you to the
ranks of peace. But remember this, always:—<em>The things
worth living for are also the things worth dying for!</em>
You and I and Suzette—yes, she’s a shipmate, too!—may
have to give our lives this very night for the cause
of world peace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young girl’s smile was as fearless as the light
that shone in her dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am ready, Don Winslow!” she said calmly. “You
can count on me to help or to suffer, as the need may
be. Even the tortures of Cho-San’s Lantern Room could
not terrify me now. Am I glad that Suzette....”</p>

<p class='c009'>As if in answer to her spoken name, the little French
maid appeared from behind the carved Chinese screen.
Impulsively she seized her mistress’ hands and squeezed
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suzette is glad also, Mademoiselle!” she exclaimed
earnestly. “But, <em>hélas</em>! There is no time to speak of that.
I have bad news for Commander Winslow!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c010'>XXVI<br /> <br /><i>THE ROOM OF A THOUSAND TORMENTS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before Don could frame a question, the little French-woman
caught his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Écoutez!</em>” she cried in a husky undertone. “Do you
know a man about twenty-six year old, with big, thick
chest and red hair dyed black?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes!” Don whipped back. “Go on! Tell me
what you mean! They haven’t caught him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they have, Monsieur!” replied Suzette. “Ah, I
had the fear it might be one of your men! They have
just brought him in, unconscious, and Cho-San is very
much excited. I hear him say, 'Now I shall grind the
truth out of that clown who calls himself Count Borg.
But first, I’ll burn this dog with dyed hair until he
howls all he knows!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Red!” Don groaned, his fists knotting at his
sides. “You mean, Suzette, that they’ve got him in the
torture room? Merciful heavens! I’d rather be there
in his place—but, quick! Tell me what we can do to
get him away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is nothing, Don!” wailed Lotus, wringing her
hands in distress. “Once they have gotten your friend
in the Lantern Room, there’s no way of rescuing him
except by a trick. The place is too well-guarded....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A trick!” exclaimed Suzette excitedly. “Let me think
jus’ a moment I believe there is a way....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s got to be!” grated Don. “Even if we lose
a chance of trapping the Scorpion’s whole bunch, we’ve
got to get Red out of this. He’s my shipmate, and....”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>“Mais, oui!”</em> cried the little maid. “We will do it with
the help of <em>le bon Dieu</em>! Only first, you and Mademoiselle
must be in the Lantern Room. You must pretend
not to care how much they torture your poor friend.
You must not let Cho-San see that you know him at
all. Then, when the chance have arrive, the lights will
go out. Your friend must be quickly freed, and then
<em>Ps-st</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Suzette’s hissed warning, Lotus broke into rapid
speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand, my little maid!” she said loudly, with
a wink at the Frenchwoman. “You think you must
play the chaperon whenever I am with Count Borg.
That is why you are always sneaking into the room!
Now, let me tell you this....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop your chatter, girl!” rasped the voice of Cho-San
behind them. “I have something of importance to
tell your André; so be silent or leave the room! Count
Borg, it appears that our task of laying hands on Don
Winslow may be unexpectedly simplified!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Cho-San!” shrugged Don indifferently. “Did
you think it was going to be difficult? I imagine if
you used a large enough mob to seize him....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you never be serious?” spat the Chinese. “To
put it bluntly, in elegant words such as you can understand,
we have nabbed a guy who looks like one of
Winslow’s pals. <em>Now</em> do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I say! That’s luck, you know! Really!” exclaimed
Don, acting his part in spite of inward anxiety.
“You mean we can use this man as bait to trap Winslow?
Have the fellow write a note to his Commander,
or something?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Or something!</em>” the Oriental mimicked him grimly.
“I can think of something even simpler than a written
note, my dear Count. With the information I can get
from this Navy spy, by the use of a little pain.... But
come with me to the Lantern Room and see for yourself!
You, too, Lotus, dismiss your maid and come with
us. It is time you should see what a little persuasion—Oriental
style—can accomplish. I have machines, copied
from the torture rooms of Ancient China, which can
extract any secret!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Chuckling evilly, the huge Scorpion leader motioned
the two young people out of the room ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he turned away, Don fought an overpowering
desire to smash his fist into Cho-San’s grinning yellow
face. Only by ramming his hands deep in his pockets
did he succeed in controlling them. Although on fire
with anxiety for Red, he must pretend a careless, somewhat
bored good humor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I feared we were going to have a tiresome
evening, Cho-San,” he murmured. “Chinese torture
machines sound awfully entertaining, I must say! Er—by
the way, I don’t recall how we get to the lamp room,
as you call it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lantern Room!” growled the Chinese. “Lotus will
lead the way and I will follow. Take the shortest
corridor, girl! I am anxious to see your André’s face when
he sets eyes on our latest captive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doorway concealed by the carved screen opened
into another dimly lighted vestibule. Don guessed that
a number of its darkly shining panels were really
hidden doors, communicating with as many passageways.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl, however, showed no hesitation in locating
the one she wanted. Her small fingers played briefly
with one of the carved dragons of the molding. There
was the usual muffled click. Two seconds later a black
opening gaped in the solid wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>This time the narrow corridor ran almost straight,
with a sharp downward slope. The distance might have
been a hundred feet before another panel slid open at
Lotus’ touch, and bright electric light streamed briefly
into the dark passageway. Knowing, yet fearing, what
he was going to see, Don Winslow stepped into the
Room of a Thousand Torments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The place was really a stone vault of immense
proportions, fifty feet wide and perhaps a hundred long.
Its groined ceiling was supported by thick stone pillars
to which were affixed chains and ring bolts of iron.</p>

<p class='c009'>Along the walls stood a weird array of mechanical
monsters, some of them so crudely made that they
might have been centuries old. Don glimpsed a
medieval “rack” for pulling living human bodies apart,
a rude “wheel” between whose heavy spokes human
legs and arms could be broken like matchsticks, an
“iron maiden” whose hinged and hollow halves were
spiked with deadly knife blades.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were rows of other horrible machines at which
he barely glanced. What drew his attention like a
terrible magnet was the prone figure of Red Pennington,
still in his valet’s garb, lying on a dark stained
plank table. Blood trickling from Red’s broken scalp
had smeared the chalklike whiteness of his face. So
deathly was his appearance that the two Chinese
hatchet men standing guard above him looked like
murderers gloating over their kill!</p>

<p class='c009'>Biting hard on his tongue, Don Winslow held back
his rage. Still keeping his outward pose of lazy boredom,
he turned to the Scorpion leader.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, come now, Cho-San!” he protested. “What
kind of a silly joke is this? The fellow’s dead as dust!
No fun in tormenting a corpse, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a feline hiss, Cho-San leaped past him, shouldering
aside the nearest hatchet man. Placing his ear to
Red’s chest, he listened for the heartbeat. The silence in
the great, vaulted room was breathless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abruptly the big Oriental straightened up, motioning
the guards away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The man is not quite dead; we can quickly revive
him,” he said. “Come nearer, Count Borg! We shall
show you some fun <em>at the expense of your own valet</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” cried Don sharply, striding across
to the table. “Why, you’re right, Cho-San! I didn’t
recognize him with all that blood on his face. But see
here—you can’t put the screws on my valet, you know!
He’s just a harmless chap I picked up to do for me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ummmmm-hmmmmmm! Of course, of course!”
rumbled Cho-San. “Just a harmless chap you—or perhaps
someone else—told to follow our car this evening!
Well, my dear Count Borg, he succeeded, as you observe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The guards had returned with two buckets of water
and a wide leather strap. At a gesture from Cho-San,
they sloshed the water over Red’s body from head to
foot. As soon as both buckets were empty one of the
hatchet men began slapping their bound and helpless
victim’s face with the heavy strap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Red groaned, rolling partly on his side. The
man with the strap stepped away. At the same time,
Cho-San pushed Don forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The trick was cleverly planned. Only luck and Don’s
presence of mind prevented a showdown then and
there. As it happened, Red in his half-conscious state
still thought he was back at the Empire rehearsing the
part of “Penny.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir! I’ll get right up, sir!” he mumbled, opening
one eye. “I didn’t mean to fall asleep, but ... mmmmm—my head!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment Don flashed him a warning signal
often used between them—a sharp lift of the right
eyebrow. And, foggy as poor Red’s brain still was, he
got it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of answering, he shut his mouth and groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sigh of inward relief, Don Winslow went on
with the act. Until the chance should come for a getaway,
he must play for time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, my man!” he snapped angrily. “What
on earth possessed you to follow my friend’s car this
evening? Hang it! If this is some stupid police trick....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, my dear Count!” chorded Cho-San, seizing
Red by the scalp. “It’s a trick of the famous Navy
Intelligence, if anything. Look closely at this stout
lieutenant’s hair—dyed black, <em>except at the roots</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A flat accusation could not have been more menacing
than Cho-San’s leer. Yet, somehow Don sensed that
the Chinese was still only guessing. With a puzzled
frown he returned the man’s snaky gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A lieutenant?” he drawled. “Oh, of course! You
mean Red Pennington. But really, Cho-San, this fellow
Penny couldn’t be Don Winslow’s shipmate. I picked
him up only today on the sidewalk, mooching for
dimes. He told me he’d been a valet and I hired him.
Even bought him an outfit of clothes. Come now, Cho-San,
admit that your idea’s a bit fantastic! Besides, how
could Pennington have got here so soon from Haiti,
old dear? Ha-ha! I’ve got you there, haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless,” smiled the Chinese with sinister emphasis,
“—unless you, my dear Don Winslow, brought him
with you as a passenger in the plane that Michael
Splendor <em>allowed</em> you to steal!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c010'>XXVII<br /> <br /><i>WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh-h-h!” Lotus’ gasp of amazement was well faked.
“Why, Cho-San, unless you’re joking you’re insane to
think of such a thing! This isn’t Don Winslow—it’s
<em>André</em>! I know because I—I love him! Even you, Cho-San,
must admit a woman can recognize the man she
loves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the Scorpion leader stood snarling
like a tiger that had missed its kill. His lips writhed
back and strange animal sounds came through his
bared yellow teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ar-r-rgh! So!” he growled. “We shall see. We shall
see if you have turned traitor to Scorpia, my little Lotus.
I know one way to answer both questions. Stand aside!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Forcing her back with a sweep of his loglike arm,
Cho-San erupted into sing-song Chinese commands.
While he was still speaking, the two hatchet men
leaped to obey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington was lifted from the table, carried
to a spot beneath the nearest stone arch, and held there
upright, while Cho-San advanced upon him with the
tread of a big jungle cat. Seizing Red’s bound wrists,
the Chinese jerked them toward a loop of wire which
hung down from the arch’s apex.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great guns, Lotus!” whispered Don, his lips barely
moving. “We’ve got to do something quick. They’re
going to hang Red up by the thumbs—torture him
before our eyes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl nodded silently. Her face was dead white,
her lips a thin purple line. With Don at her side, she
made for the leering Scorpion leader.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t, Cho-San!” she exclaimed in a low, tragic
voice. “If you are such a fiend that you must torture
somebody, take me! I could stand it better than watching....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Oo-oo-oonh!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The moan of agony was wrung from Red’s lips, as
Cho-San threw his weight on the pulley rope. The
stocky lieutenant now hung by his thumbs from the
wire loop which had cut through skin and tissue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Lotus’ warning nudge kept Don from throwing
himself then and there upon the slant-eyed devil who
was leaning on that rope. With a supreme effort he
controlled himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suzette, he recalled, had mentioned a plan of rescue
which Lotus would attempt when the chance came.
Until then he must play the game!</p>

<p class='c009'>Lotus, he noticed, had moved over to the nearest
wall. She leaned against it in a pathetic huddle, her
hands covering her face. So convincing was her pose of
despair that Don wondered if it were acting at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red anger again clouded his brain. His hand crept
to the lapel of his dinner jacket within quick reach of
the automatic beneath his armpit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I advise you to keep your hand away from your
weapon, my friend!” came Cho-San’s ugly growl.
“Back there in the shadows stands one of my personal
bodyguards, with a Thompson submachine gun aimed
at your midriff. At the first signal from me—he will
make a bloody rag of your shirt front. Ah-ha! You see
him now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly Don’s narrowed gaze made out the shadowy
figure behind an unlighted archway. His hand lifted
to cover a well-faked yawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I see him!” he murmured lazily. “But
why all the dramatics, Cho-San? So far the fun you
promised has been frightfully tiresome. I’ve heard men
groaning in pain before in my life, you know. Really,
this isn’t even interesting....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be, my dear Borg-Winslow!” spat the Chinese.
“It will be most interesting when Lieutenant Pennington
starts to tell us—between groans—just which
your name really is! And if this simple thumb-stretcher
doesn’t work, I have a new electrical machine which
tears the brain apart, bit by bit. Perhaps you would
like me to give you a taste of that, when I am finished
with your friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a ghastly chuckle, Cho-San turned back to his
work. The pulley rope tightened. From Red’s anguished
throat burst another pitiful moan.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that instant the huge room was plunged in darkness.
There was a scuffle of feet, two hard, thudding
blows—the sound of one or more falling bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>A girl’s scream rang out, followed by Cho-San’s bass
bellow. Then came silence, more stifling than the thick
darkness of the vault.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>In contrast to the gruesome quiet of Cho-San’s dark
torture room, loud argument resounded in the brightly
lighted office of the local Intelligence Bureau. Michael
Splendor, just arrived from the airport to take charge
of operations, was laying down the law to the chief
of the San Francisco operatives.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all ye’re fault, Hammond!” he roared, pounding
the desk with an enormous hairy fist. “Ye should have
seen the game was up when Cho-San butted in on the
party and spirited Don Winslow away in his big black
car! Ye should have had a squad of expert men ready
to shadow him, instead of leavin’ it to a young officer
who’s not trained to the work. Now, repeat if ye will,
the story of that taxi driver who said he’d been hired
to follow Cho-San’s limousine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know he’s the one who drove Pennington, because
we took his license number,” Hammond stated flatly.
“His name’s Grogan, and he seems to be on the level.
He says they lost Cho-San’s limousine somewhere in
Chinatown. They followed another by mistake and it
brought them up in front of Cho-San’s curio shop.
Pennington told Grogan to stop and wait while he took
a look at the place. While the lieutenant was gone, two
tough eggs from the second car shoved pistols through
Grogan’s window and told him to drive on. Grogan
had no choice but to obey. He came back here to his
regular stand, and we nabbed him for questioning.
That’s all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And isn’t it enough to persuade ye that both Pennington
and Commander Winslow are in deadly peril?”
retorted Splendor bitterly. “Why did ye have to wait
till I arrived, before raidin’ Cho-San’s layout? Get busy,
now, call up all your reserves—every fightin’ man ye
can deputize for the job. What’s holdin’ ye?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, sir, now that you’ve ordered it!” replied
Hammond, his honest face flushing red. “Of course
you’re aware we’ll need to find evidence of lawless
activities in order to justify a raid. Cho-San has both
wealth and influence to fight criminal charges in any
court!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what of that?” the lion-maned cripple roared
back. “By this time Don Winslow and Pennington will
have found enough evidence to hang that yellow fiend
higher than Haman. Away with ye, Hammond! Collect
your men, and be sure that one of them is husky
enough to carry me on his back. Legs or no legs, I’ll
lead this raid if it’s me last act!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without a word Hammond departed, swept from the
room by the blast of Splendor’s fierce energy. As the
door closed behind him another opened to admit Mercedes
Colby still in her flying togs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard that last, Mr. Splendor!” she cried, coming
quickly to the cripple’s chair. “No wonder Hammond
calls you 'the old Lion’! But you were joking, weren’t
you, about leading this raid on Cho-San’s place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faith, and why should I joke about that?” snorted
the veteran Intelligence officer. “Have I been in a jokin’
mood since we took off from Haiti this mornin’?
At least I can shoot with the best of Hammond’s deputies,
and that’s all I ask a chance to do. But what about
the thing I sent ye to find out, child? Is Count Borg
well guarded in that room Hammond assigned him
to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Too</em> well guarded, if you take the Count’s word for
it,” replied Mercedes with a smile. “Mr. Hammond
assigned a couple of his best detectives, armed to the
teeth, to guard the doors. Of course they didn’t arm
Count Borg because he’s a prisoner, at least, technically.
But I don’t think any Scorpion gang is going to kidnap
him tonight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not, my dear,” sighed Splendor, wagging his
gray maned head. “But if Cho-San has pierced Don
Winslow’s disguise, as I fear he has done, things may
happen too fast for us to prevent...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Oh-h-h! The lights!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercedes’ gasp cut through a pitch black room.
Without warning every light had gone out, not only in
the office building but in the street outside.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>In a darkness just as absolute, Don Winslow plunged
blindly forward, bearing Red’s helpless weight. Lotus’
scream had given him his direction. If only he didn’t
bump into a pillar or a prowling hatchet man, he’d
make it to where she waited!</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a small, firm hand clutched his arm.
Without question he obeyed its pressure, felt himself being
guided past an unseen obstruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next instant a cool draught struck his face. The
guiding hand gave his arm one quick, farewell squeeze.
Somewhere behind him sounded the click of a closing
panel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The darkness was as thick as ever, but now he sensed
that he was no longer in the vaulted torture room. That
cool current of air suggested a tunnel or corridor connecting
with the world above ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily he had remembered to take a small pocket
torch when he went down to dinner that evening. Its
white beam now showed up the rough stone walls of
a passageway, like the one leading from the elevator.
But that was not all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within arm’s reach stood the French maid, Suzette,
her finger to her lips in silent warning. As Don met
her eyes, she beckoned urgently and turned to vanish
in the black shadows.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the flashlight found her again Suzette was several
yards up the tunnel, running like a boy. Don followed
somewhat more slowly, trying to keep Red’s
head from bumping the low, timbered roof. He was
breathing heavily when he finally overtook the French-woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We mus’ be ver’ quick, Commander!” she whispered,
halting at a place where the passageway
branched. “Your poor friend, is he too badly hurt to
walk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so’s you’d notice it, Miss!” came Red’s husky
answer. “Just get these ropes off my hands and ankles,
and I’ll manage to toddle. Got a knife, Skipper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s penknife was already out, sawing at the brutally
tight cords.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is easier than getting that loop of wire off your
thumbs in the dark, shipmate!” he panted. “I was
afraid those two cat-eyed hatchet men would come back
at me before I got you clear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a chance!” grinned Red Pennington rubbing
his blood smeared wrists. “You hit ’em so hard they
couldn’t even crawl away, Skipper. You must have
judged their positions just right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Allons donc, Messieurs!</em> We waste time!” cut in
Suzette’s sharp whisper. “We are not out of the danger
yet. This left-hand passage—come! And run as if the
devil-dog Marines were after you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c010'>XXVIII<br /> <br /><i>PULLING DEATH’S WHISKERS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Red Pennington made a desperate spurt to catch up.
His feet and hands were still numb; his head ached
fiercely; his stomach was seasick for the first time in
years. But that crack about the Marines was too much
to swallow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You got it wrong, lady!” he puffed, stumbling at
Suzette’s heels. “You mean run like <em>we</em> were chasin’
the <em>Marines</em>, don’t you? No gob ever yet ran away
from a leatherneck...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pipe down and save your breath, sailor!” warned
Don. “Suzette’s leading this patrol, and it’s not over
yet by a long shot!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke the fleet-footed French girl darted into
another branch tunnel. This one doubled back after a
few feet, then branched again, and continued at right
angles. In the next few minutes the young officers realized
they were deep in an underground maze. Here
anyone but a guide with an exceptional memory would
lose the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now another danger made itself apparent. From
time to time distant shouts and the clatter of a machine
gun echoed through the rocky labyrinth. In quick whispers
tossed over her shoulders Suzette urged greater
speed. The noticeable dimming of Don’s flashlight gave
added warning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Despite aching muscles and tortured lungs, Red
forced himself to a swifter pace. As a result, he tripped
and fell. Before Don could help him, he was running
again, ignoring a pair of gashed knees. Sheer fighting
courage kept him up, defying the weight of a body
built more for comfort than for speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once Suzette slowed and stopped, throwing
back a warning arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put out your torch, <em>Monsieur</em> Winslow!” she hissed.
“Around the next corner is a machine gun in a 'pill-box.’
It stands between us and freedom. Either we mus’
silence it or be trap here where we stand!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see,” muttered Don. “But you must have made
some plan for doing that, Suzette. What’s our best
play?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the pitch darkness the girl grasped a sleeve of each
of the two men. Not until their three heads were literally
together, did she reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can think of jus’ one way to do,” she said tensely.
“Somewhere along the next passage is a photo-electric
trigger, worked by infra-red light. If we try to pass it,
the overhead lights flash on, the machine gunner begin
to shoot, and we die with fifty bullet holes in our backs!
So this, <em>Messieurs</em>, is my plan. When the lights flash on,
I will empty my small pistol through the machine gunner’s
loophole. That will keep him busy until you pass
beyond the next turn. Before he dare to look again,
I follow you, and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing doing, Suzette!” Don cut in abruptly.
“That way you’d be sacrificing your life for us and you
know it. I’ve got another idea. We’ll silence that machine
gun before the lights flash up in the passageway.
All I ask is for you to show me that 'pillbox’ loophole
<em>in the dark</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well trained by the French Secret Service, Suzette
knew the voice of authority. Without hesitation she
took Don’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come then, <em>Monsieur</em>!” she whispered. “And your
friend—he mus’ keep close behind us, but make no
sound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the next thirty feet they proceeded at a snail’s pace,
careful not to make the slightest sound. At last, however,
Suzette halted, to grope for a few seconds at an
unseen wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don guessed what she was doing. When the tug
came on his wrist, he let his own hand be guided until
it touched the edges of a square opening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The loophole! And protruding from it, Don could
feel the ugly steel snout of a submachine gun. The
other end, he knew, was held by a ready killer, whose
grip need only tighten on the trigger to spray forth
a stream of lead and fire!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve heard of pulling Death’s whiskers,” the young
officer thought with a slight shiver, “but this is the
nearest I’ve come to doing it yet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His next movements were coolly calculated. Fixing
the loophole’s position in mind, he took a fresh grip
on the unlighted pocket torch. At the same time he
drew the snub-nosed .38 caliber automatic from his
shoulder holster. Lastly, to steady his aim, he drew a
single deep breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest happened too fast for words to describe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flash of Don’s torch, the blast of his pistol, a
muffled explosion inside the concrete wall—all followed
in the same split instant. The scream of human pain
that issued through the loophole seemed to be minutes
later, though actually it was hardly a second.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the cry still echoed, a blinding flood of light
showed three crouched figures racing for the tunnel’s
end. So cramped was the passage that bullets from the
“pillbox” could have cut them down like toy soldiers,
but not even one shot rang out. The next instant all
three had disappeared around a rocky projection of the
wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow’s dimming flashlight now showed a
rough-boarded staircase, leading upward. At Suzette’s
heels, the two officers mounted, three steps at a time.
At the top they crossed a narrow hall, burst through
a half-concealed door, and came out into the open air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, in what seemed to be a dark alley, Red Pennington
grabbed at Don’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Avast, Skipper!” he panted! “Lemme get a breath
or two before we—ugh—go on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Non! Non!</em> Not yet, <em>Messieurs</em>!” the Frenchwoman’s
voice lashed back. “Soon we will stop, but it
is not safe yet. <em>Allons!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>As if to confirm her words, high-pitched, Oriental
voices broke out in the building behind them. Red
waited for no more, but lunged ahead, sobbing for
breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The route they followed for the next five minutes
was as mixed up as the maze of underground tunnels
they had left. Back and forth through dark alleyways
and darker buildings they dodged. Suzette had evidently
studied the route by daylight, and kept a map
of it in her mind for just such an emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the last door, which seemed to be that of a basement
apartment, she used a key.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This place is safe if we do not show the light, <em>Messieurs</em>,”
she panted. “Many weeks ago I have rent and
furnish it under another name. Beyond is a door opening
to another street where you can get a taxi. And
now, while Suzette gets her breath, tell me what you
did to that machine gun, Commander. I die of curiousness!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I took a chance and tried to plug his gun muzzle
with my own bullet,” Don answered. “Just by luck I
did it first try. Of course, when the machine gunner
pulled the trigger, his weapon blew up! That’s all there
was to it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Except a chilled steel nerve and cracking good
marksmanship!” grunted Red Pennington. “If you’d
missed that first shot the guy inside would have blown
your head off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mais, oui!</em>” chimed in Suzette. “We owe our lives
to the so brave Commander! But now I mus’ speak of
other things. Tell me, Monsieur Winslow, how many
men you can bring for a raid tonight on the
underworld of Scorpia? We mus’ strike now, while so many
agents are here for Cho-San’s big conference!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, Suzette!” exclaimed Don. “Tonight’s
the time, and I’ve asked our local office to hold fifty
fighting men within call in case I needed them. Michael
Splendor has just arrived and is probably running them
up now. I could lead them back here within an hour,
probably...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that is perfect, Commander!” cried the little
Frenchwoman. “Go now, and bring your men to the
shop of Cho-San. I will have the door unlock, so you
need make no noise. From the shop I will conduct you
to the secret gallery w’ich overlook the Scorpion’s great
Assembly Room. The agents will soon be gather there
to hear Cho-San’s instructions for a new world war
plot. Your men will then take them by surprise and
make the—w’at you call—<em>clean-up</em> in one big swoop!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll do that or die trying, Suzette!” Don exclaimed
heartily. “Now lead the way to the other door, and
we’ll be off. If you get a chance to speak to Lotus, tell
her we’ll be back to take her away from Cho-San’s torture
rooms and slimy passages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suzette did not reply. Taking Don’s hand she led the
two young officers swiftly through the apartment and
an adjoining basement. As they came out onto a darkened
areaway, Don Winslow thought he heard the little
maid sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Voilà!</em>” she said in a choked voice. “You can see the
street beyond that alley to the right. And hurry, <em>Messieurs</em>,
if you hope to see the little Lotus alive. I have
fear that Cho-San has punish her already for her part
in helping you escape!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s groan came through gritted teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven grant you’re wrong about that!” he said
hoarsely. “If that child has given her life for us, we’ll
never rest till we wipe the last memory of Scorpia from
the earth! Come, Red! Every second counts against us
now!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c010'>XXIX<br /> <br /><i>THE WRATH OF CHO-SAN</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Feet stamped and flashlights blazed through the office
building of the local Intelligence Bureau. Above
the sounds of disciplined search, Michael Splendor’s
great voice could be heard roaring questions and orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had been two or three minutes time, however,
between the moment the lights went out and the organization
of a flashlight brigade. In that brief space the
emissaries of Scorpia had pulled off their carefully
planned raid and departed. As souvenirs of their visit
they had left two drugged and unconscious detectives
outside an upper floor room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Count Borg had vanished, snatched from under the
noses of Hammond’s best men; and no one had seen
him go. The fact was a stunning blow to the Bureau
chief; but to Splendor, it was just one more challenge
to fight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Find out how many men ye’ve got here now, Hammond!”
he bellowed down the corridor. “Bring them
back to the main office so I can look them over. If I
spot no spies among them, we’ll start at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The office lights were still out, but darkness was no
obstacle to the gray-haired cripple. Holding an electric
torch in his teeth, he propelled his wheel chair through
the door and around the long oak table which ran almost
the length of the room. Satisfied that no prowlers
lurked in the shadows, he took his place beside the single
entrance and waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moments later, Hammond finished rounding up his
force of deputies. As he led them down the corridor
toward the main office Splendor’s bull voice hailed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand opposite me, Hammond,” the veteran ordered,
“and let your men pass between us one by one. That
way we’ll be sure there’s no traitor among them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke there was a sudden stir among the group
of men outside. It ended briefly with a cry of discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got him, sir!” cried one of the deputies. “This
fellow didn’t want to stand inspection, I guess. I caught
him trying to slip away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Spotlighted by a score of torch beams, the culprit was
pushed forward to the door. In his light topcoat he
looked like a slim boy, hanging his head as if in shame.</p>

<p class='c009'>A flick of Hammond’s hand knocked off the low
pulled fedora and brought a gasp from every onlooker.
The youthful face, under a mass of tightly wound hair,
was Mercedes Colby’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care—I’m going with you anyway!” the girl
exploded, turning upon Michael Splendor. “I’m no
fluffy, helpless child to be sent to bed when there’s a
real job of work to do! If a man with no legs can risk
his life to help Don Winslow, so can a girl. And you’re
not going to stop me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Throwing off the borrowed topcoat, Mercedes stood
there slim and defiant in her boyish flying togs. Her
clear eyes glowed like battle lanterns in the light of
Splendor’s torch beam. Before the veteran could frame
a reply, a voice outside in the corridor drew everyone’s
attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you, Mercedes!” cried Don Winslow,
striding up the corridor with Red at his heels. “You’re
not the only woman who’s risking her life tonight in
the cause of humanity. When he knows the truth, even
Mr. Splendor won’t try to keep you back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Don’s arrival acted like a powerful stimulant to the
spirits of everyone there. What had seemed a dangerous
duty to most of Hammond’s hard-boiled deputies, now
took on the color of high adventure. There was something
in the young Commander’s presence which always
fired men to eager loyalty, and they expressed it
now in a muffled cheer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Briefly Don outlined the situation up to the moment
he and Red had left Suzette. In return Hammond told
him of Count Borg’s disappearance, and the preparations
made up to then.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each deputy, the Bureau chief explained, was armed
with two pistols. Half of them carried Thompson submachine
guns and the rest a supply of tear gas bombs.
There were extra weapons and gas masks in the office,
he said, from which Don and Red could choose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t see that there’s any need to wait, then,” said
Don. “As soon as Mr. Splendor has finished his inspection,
we can start!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For weapons, both the Navy officers selected regulation
Enfield rifles, which could be used as terrible clubs
in hand-to-hand fighting. Mercedes, still insistent on
going along, was fitted out with a bulletproof vest under
her light topcoat. Her weapons consisted of a pair
of automatics, one loaded with tear gas cartridges. The
three of them were the last to pass Michael Splendor’s
swift inspection.</p>

<p class='c009'>At his own signal, the veteran was lifted pickaback
to the shoulders of a powerful deputy, and carried at
the head of his fifty men to the cars waiting outside.
With a few low spoken words, the deputies jammed
into the vehicles. Doors slammed, starters whirred, and
the raiding party was on its way, speeding through the
foggy streets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twenty minutes later, the leading car braked to a
stop in front of Cho-San’s darkened shop. As the others
lined up behind it, the crippled but dauntless leader
headed the silent rush of fighting men across the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the shop door Don and Red caught up with him.
The knob turned easily at the young Commander’s
touch. An instant later ten flashlight beams picked out
the small figure of Suzette, waiting in the center of the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven you are arrive, <em>Messieurs</em>!” the girl
exclaimed. “The little Lotus still lives, and they have
just brought in Count Borg. Follow me quickly if you
would save them!”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>Deep under the fortresslike mansion of Cho-San, a
huge room had been hollowed out of the native earth
and rock. Across one end of it stretched a platform,
equipped with lights to produce every sort of stage effect.
The room’s main floor space was filled with regular
theater seats enough to accommodate two hundred
persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>At present more than half of the seats were occupied.
Men and women of all nationalities sat conversing in
twenty different tongues and dialects. As if to add
drama to the scene, each appeared in his native costume,
however outlandish it happened to be. There
were dark men from India, Morocco, and the South
Sea Islands; black men from Africa, and yellow men
from the Far East. Mingled with these were fair-skinned
women from North and South America and
from the glittering capitals of Europe—a strangely
varied and colorful assembly!</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet for all their differences of age, sex and race, these
people had one trait in common. It was an expression
of reckless cruelty, like a brand burned deep into their
very souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nothing strange about that, of course, for
these were the key men and women of Scorpia, the
chief spies and agents of a world-wide crime club. Success
for them meant always disaster for civilized nations—revolutions,
wars, and bloody conquests, from
which the Scorpion’s brood could pick their illegal
wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound of hard-voiced laughter and conversation
died suddenly. Weird music throbbed out from some
hidden source. Slowly the great curtain of purple velvet
rolled back upon a scene of medieval horror.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three spotlights threw a merciless radiance upon the
darkened stage. In the center stood Cho-San, robed in
the rich silks of Ancient China, his hands clasped under
loose sleeves. Motionless as a statue, his huge figure
dominated the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Cho-San’s right a second spotlight circled a great
wooden wheel, to whose spokes had been lashed the
body of a girl. Still clad in her white satin evening
gown, Lotus’ young beauty was in tragic contrast with
her stiff, tortured pose.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third part of the gruesome tableau was a heavy
wooden stretcher, or rack, to which a man was bound
by hands and feet. So taut were the ropes that another
turn of the machine’s windlass would have jerked his
joints apart.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this the audience took in before the first gasp of
astonishment escaped their lips. Like a wind through
dry branches a harsh whisper swept across the room:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Lotus! Count Borg! <em>What does it mean, Cho-San?</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whisper died into silence. Openmouthed the
assembled agents of Scorpia sat staring at the terrible,
unspoken wrath of Cho-San. As they watched, the towering
figure of the Chinese seemed to swell and palpitate
with voiceless fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it came, his first word rolled out like an
organ’s shuddering bass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Treason!” he thundered. “Treason to the power of
Scorpia! These two, about to die in torment, dared to
defy the Master; and I, Cho-San, accuse them before
you all!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c010'>XXX<br /> <br /><i>TRAPPED</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The hundred-odd men and women of Scorpia shivered
in the darkness beyond the stage. All had heard
tales of Cho-San’s torture room. Some even had visited
the vaulted chamber and seen old bloodstains on those
devilish machines.</p>

<p class='c009'>They remembered their fellow agents who had disappeared
to be “tried” later in this same underground
auditorium. In such cases the accused were brought on
the stage to give their “confessions”; but their broken
bodies and fear stricken tones told plainer than words
of secret torments. Not even the few who were released
after trial ever told exactly what had happened to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now these members of Scorpia’s Inner Council
were to see with their own eyes the fate of two who had
defied the Scorpion’s power. Their cruel natures were
as thrilled by the prospect as they were awed by thought
that their own turn might come some day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the mind of the audience which heard
Cho-San’s grim accusation. With savage eagerness they
drank in the Scorpion leader’s every word, while their
eyes gloated over those helpless victims on the wheel
and rack.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the tread of a great jungle beast, Cho-San approached
the half-conscious Lotus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Facing the assembly, the Chinese raised his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This girl, this fickle traitoress,” he cried, “has gone
over to the enemy, body and soul. In a few minutes you
will hear her confess her guilt under mortal pain. But
first—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cho-San paused dramatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First,” he repeated, “she will listen to the screams
of this other enemy of Scorpia—the man who was once
a member of this very Inner Council—Count André
Borg! We shall see what confession another turn of the
ropes will wring from him ... Dr. Skell!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Into the spotlight moved a tall man garbed in a white
laboratory coat. His bald, skull-like head turned to face
Cho-San.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One turn?” he asked, laying a bony hand upon the
rack’s windlass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chinese nodded. Slowly the rack’s wooden crank
moved downward, tightening the ropes. Count Borg’s
body stiffened under the frightful tension. Through his
clenched jaws issued a grinding sob of pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another turn and his bones snap out of their sockets,”
came the dry croak of Dr. Skell. “Shall I go on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! No!” came Lotus’ frantic cry. “Torture me,
Cho-San, but not André! Anything—<em>anything but
that</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tear him apart!” snarled the Scorpion leader. “Put
your weight on that windlass, or—”</p>

<p class='c009'>CR-RACK!</p>

<p class='c009'>The whipping report of a rifle slapped against the
walls. With a queer, animal whine, the bony Skell
shrank back, his bullet grazed hand dripping red.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment paralysis seemed to grip the assembled
Council of Scorpia. Then through tense silence the
voice of Don Winslow cut like a knife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold it, Cho-San! We’ve got every exit covered.
You’d better give up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Quick as a cat, the big Chinese leaped. Outside the
spotlight, his figure was a swift vanishing blur. The
slam of an automatic pistol came seconds too late, as
Michael Splendor charged onto the stage at the head
of twenty fighting men.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaping down across the footlights, Don Winslow,
Red Pennington and a dozen of Hammond’s men lined
up with ready guns. Yet in the face of that threat more
than half the Scorpion assembly had drawn concealed
pistols.</p>

<p class='c009'>A single shot would touch off a battle to the death.
None knew it better than Michael Splendor as he
perched on the shoulders of a powerful deputy, full
in the spotlight’s glare. He knew also that men and
women, however desperate, can sometimes be bluffed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every exit to this room is blocked by armed men!”
he announced in a ringing voice. “Throw down your
weapons and ye’ll take no harm. Fight and ye’ll get
licked anyway. Which will ye choose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A low muttering began among the trapped councilmen
of Scorpia. Above the babel of whispers a single
voice rose clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San escaped!” rang the defiant shout. “The secret
corridors are NOT blocked. We will scatter—and
catch these fools in their own trap!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A roar of approval went up from the crowd. In three
scrambling groups the assembly broke for the sides and
rear of the auditorium, avoiding the platform. A few of
the nearest kept their eyes and pistols trained on the line
of riflemen, but they clearly wished to postpone the
shooting.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the mob’s angry surprise, this means of escape
had been forestalled. When the paneled exit doors slid
back, a squad of deputies barred each opening with
clubbed guns. At the same time Splendor’s bellow rose
above the tumult.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On with your gas masks, boys!” he ordered. “We’ll
have these wastrels chokin’ for breath in two minutes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Suiting action to words, the veteran pulled the ring
of a tear gas grenade and flung it. Twice more he repeated
the motion before bullets from the ranks of
Scorpia drilled him and his human mount. With a
groan the big deputy sank to his knees, spilling his
wounded chief to the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the embattled exits more gas grenades were
being hurled, but there the press of fighting bodies was
too close for pistol work. The same sort of struggle
was taking place where Don Winslow and his squad of
fighters held back a rush for the stage exits.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only shooting appeared to be aimed at Splendor
and the fallen deputy, sprawled in the white glare of
the spotlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Mercedes Colby who acted in the nick of time
to save them. Already she had cut loose the racked body
of Count Borg and freed his sobbing companion. Now,
braving the bullets that clipped across the stage, she
started to drag Michael Splendor out of the light.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment two Malay councilmen broke
through Don’s thin line of fighting deputies. Maddened
by the smart of tear gas they leaped onto the platform,
armed with long, glittering knives. Their yells of tigerish
fury announced that they had gone <em>amok</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bullets could not have stopped them in time, yet
Mercedes sprang to face them. Her left hand pistol
barked. White smoke from the tear gas cartridges
belched in the face of her attackers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their yells ended in choking grunts. Clawing at their
blinded eyes, the Malays staggered back to plunge over
the platform’s edge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c010'>XXXI<br /> <br /><i>THE SECRET CHAMBER</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>From then on it was a losing battle for the Scorpion
forces. The tear gas, now filling the entire room, effectively
blinded everyone but the masked raiders. One
after another the furious councilmen gave up the struggle
to nurse their swollen eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Winslow sensed the turn of the tide. Turning
back, he leaped onto the stage which was still clear of
the fumes, and raised his mask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give up, you dupes of Scorpia!” he shouted. “All
those who have had enough, come this way!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an instant rush toward the platform. With
streaming, smarting eyes, the men and women of Cho-San’s
erstwhile audience fought their way toward the
sound of Don’s voice, glad to surrender. The only ones
who stayed back were the twenty or more who had run
into a hard-swung gun butt, and lay snoring where
they had dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of Hammond’s deputies, however, ten men were
wounded by knives or bullets, and three had given their
lives. Don Winslow and Red each bled from knife
slashes received in the melee. The old lion, Michael
Splendor, had taken a bullet through the throat, but
he still lived by a miracle. Mercedes, with Lotus’ help,
had just finished bandaging the veteran’s wound when
Don located them back stage. Count Borg lay near by,
conscious but unable to rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The problem now was to evacuate safely both walking
persons and wounded. Don himself had just turned
back to take charge when the little French maid, Suzette,
appeared suddenly out of the shadows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come with me, <em>Monsieur</em>,—you and two others!”
she cried, seizing the young Commander’s arm. “I have
locate Cho-San and Scorpion himself in their secret
chamber. They are prepare now the getaway with their
treasure and secret papers. In a few moments they will
be gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington and Mercedes were near enough to
overhear. Their response was instantaneous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re with you, Don!” they said, almost together.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the other side of the platform a big man was
approaching, his tommy-gun held across an arm. As
the newcomer raised his gas mask, Don hailed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hammond! Take charge of clearing out prisoners
and wounded!” he ordered. “Get Mr. Splendor out
first. We’ll see you topside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the Bureau Chief could answer Don turned,
heading into the stage wing at Suzette’s heels. Mercedes
and Red followed, stowing away their gas masks as
they ran. If more fighting were ahead of them, they
would need free hands and clear eyesight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suzette led them through a rapid succession of passageways
and sliding panels, without stopping for explanations.
Not until all four of them had crowded into
a tiny elevator and shut the door, did she answer any
of the questions in the others’ minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are now descending to the basement of Cho-San’s
big house,” she whispered. “This is the way he
escaped a few minutes ago. I guess where he have gone,
and follow him by a roundabout way. I listen and hear
him talk with the Scorpion in the secret chamber. Now
if we are quick....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevator stopped with scarcely a bump. As the
door slid open, Don stepped out, his rifle at the ready.
The others piled out after him, into a large, magnificently
furnished room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the Scorpion’s study,” hissed Suzette. “The
hidden chamber is beyond that tall mirror. Come, and
keep your weapons ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once across the big room, the Frenchwoman motioned
the others to take up positions on each side of
the long <em>cheval</em> glass. The moment they had done so,
she pressed a hidden spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without a sound the mirror tilted outward from the
top to show a small, lighted room beyond. A glimpse
of two men in overcoats standing beside an open safe
was enough for Don. His rifle swung up to cover them,
just as the door mechanism stopped halfway open with
a click.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the sound both men spun around, their hands too
full to reach for a weapon. Cho-San’s right arm held a
bundle of black bound ledgers, his left hand a heavy
satchel. His leer of fury was devilish. The other man’s
face was masked by a purple cloth. Beneath the sleeves
of the black overcoat, his gloved hands gripped a pair
of suitcases.</p>

<p class='c009'>For ten seconds the tableau held, in an atmosphere
charged with menace. Strangely enough, it was Suzette’s
half sobbing cry that broke the tension.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Hélas, Monsieur!</em>” wailed the little Frenchwoman.
“I cannot make the door open more!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, Suzette,” came Don’s calm reply. “I’ve
got the Scorpion covered. Cho-San, if you can lower
that door from the inside, better do it and give up peaceably.
You can’t dodge the rifle Pennington has aimed
at you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, Winslow,” the big Chinese growled, letting
fall his armful of ledgers. “I’ll have to use a key
to release the mechanism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Coolly Cho-San slipped a hand into his overcoat
pocket. As he withdrew it, Don caught the light of a
small, shiny object. Without warning it flicked from
the yellow fingers, straight toward the half-open door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Smoke puffed in a sudden cloud, obscuring the whole
opening. From behind it came a harsh mocking laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the sound died out, Don Winslow slammed
his rifle barrel into the crack of the closing mirror, jamming
its machinery. At the same time there came the
clang of a steel door somewhere inside the secret room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re gone!” yelped Red Pennington. “Quick,
Suzette! Which way can we follow ’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Back! Get back, <em>Monsieur</em>!” cried the little French
maid, tugging at his sleeve. “That smoke is deadly
poison. Quick, everyone—put on the gas masks and come
away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s right, Red!” clipped Don Winslow, whipping
out his own mask. “Clear out of here before something
worse happens! I’ll be with you as soon as I get my gun
loose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The smoke had spread out some distance from the
jammed doorway, making objects near it indistinct. As
his friends moved back, Don Winslow plunged straight
into it. For a few moments his figure vanished completely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as Red was about to go back for him he reappeared,
carrying not only his rifle but a bundle of black
leather-covered books. Without lifting his mask, he motioned
the others on, away from the spreading smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Suzette, their retreat was barely in time. Unprotected
by a gas mask, the courageous French girl had
refused to leave the room before Don appeared. Now,
reeling from a slight dose of the poison, she led them
through a panel in the farther wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the clean air of an adjoining room she motioned
her companions to remove their masks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is over now, my friends,” she said faintly, as Red
steadied her in the grip of a muscular arm. “We have
lost the Scorpion and his so evil lieutenant, but we have
failed in nothing else, I think. Thanks to Commander
Winslow, we have the evidence which will convict
many of our enemies of their hidden crimes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Following her eloquent look, Mercedes let out a muffled
cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that’s what you went back for, Don?” she gasped.
“You—you went into that gas filled room just for those
black ledgers? Oh, why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cho-San seemed to value them, and I knew he
couldn’t have stopped to pick them up,” the young
commander answered. “If they do contain the evidence
Suzette claims, they’re worth a bigger risk than I took.
And, speaking of risks, we’re none of us out of here
yet. For all we know the next room to this may be
filled with hachet men waiting to jump us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Mais non</em>,” cried Suzette, catching Mercedes’ startled
look. “I think Cho-San sent all the hachet men and
bodyguards ahead to help them with their getaway.
When they leave that secret chamber, they go by some
other passage to the outside. No doubt the cars were
waiting to take them and their men. Jus’ now this
house is safe as any church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercedes Colby slipped an arm around the little
maid’s waist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you’re right, Suzette,” she smiled, “but even
that doesn’t make me anxious to stay here. Lean your
weight on me and let’s get going. Fresh air is what
we need more than anything, except news from our
friends.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c009'>The news that reached them at the local Intelligence
Office was better than Don Winslow or any of his three
companions had dared to expect. The bullet which had
passed through Michael Splendor’s throat had missed
the large blood vessels, though coming dangerously
near to the spinal cord. The doctors’ first report gave
him more than a fighting chance to live.</p>

<p class='c009'>Count Borg’s wrenched limbs would be useless for
the next month, but his agony on the rack had somehow
torn the veil obscuring his memory. His first
words on regaining consciousness had been an anxious
question about Lotus. The girl herself was at the same
hospital, suffering from shock, but happier than she had
been in her life before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Pennington refused point-blank to be doctored
at the hospital. He insisted that Don with a first aid kit
could fix up his torn thumbs and bruised head as well
as any sawbones. He’d go to the hospital next day, he
declared, but as a visitor, not a patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>Actually it was two days before the doctors permitted
the two young officers and Mercedes Colby to visit the
crippled veteran. By that time the danger of wound
fever was past, and the “Old Lion” of the Navy Intelligence
Service was loudly demanding a sight of his
friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahoy, Commander!” he greeted, as Don stepped
into the white hospital room. “They showed me your
note about the evidence in those black ledger books.
Is it true that it clinches the guilt of all them we took
in the raid?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does more than that, sir!” smiled Don, taking the
older man’s hand. “But I’m not going to tell you another
thing till you calm down and quit trying to sit up.
A man with a bullet hole in his vertebrae ...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisht, now!” complained the dauntless cripple. “Is
that a respectful way to talk to your elders? Mercedes,
child! Tell me what’s on Commander Winslow’s mind.
Suspense is not good for a sick man, ye know that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lie down and I’ll tell you!” laughed the girl, taking
the chair Red had moved over to the bedside. “It’s just
that those ledgers contain a record of every order carried
out by Scorpion agents in the past two years. The
evidence incriminates hundreds more besides those we
captured two nights ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yeah!” put in Red Pennington with a fighting grin.
“With this evidence as a weapon, the United States
Navy is going to make a thorough clean-up on the
Scorpion! Am I right, Skipper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so, Red!” replied Don Winslow soberly. “At
least we’ll make the Americas and their two oceans an
unlucky harbor for the enemies of peace. With the aid
of all our loyal shipmates, not forgetting Suzette and
Count Borg and Lotus, too, we’ll work, we’ll live, and
if need be we’ll die to make this old world a better
place!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Amen!” responded Michael Splendor from his
sickbed. “Already ye have the Scorpion and his warmongers
on the run, but perilous waters lie before ye.
Commander. The enemy is desperate. He’ll use every
fiendish trick to wreck ye, and there’ll be a bitter fight
when ye overhaul him—perhaps in some far corner of
the earth. Me one regret is that I must lie here safe and
helpless for the next two months while me young shipmates
are riskin’ their necks on land or sea or in the
air!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Impulsively Don gripped Splendor’s big hand with
both his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You old fire-eater!” he exclaimed. “You’ll be back
with us <em>inside</em> of two months, if my guess is right! Not
even a bullet nicked spine is going to keep you out of
our country’s fight to wipe war—and the threat of war—from
the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May your words come true!” replied the crippled
veteran earnestly. “And may victory crown your every
venture, Don Winslow of the Navy!”</p>
